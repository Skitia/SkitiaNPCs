@1    = ~Poor children. But they shouldn't be here. This is a dangerous position for them.~
@2    = ~It is wonderful to see you again, Coran. I recall your time with us fondly.~
@3    = ~Is this really Drizzt? Where is my quill, I need to make sure I remember everything that happens next!~
@4    = ~This is so exciting. I need to make space in my book for this. I don't think anyone will believe it when they hear we fought alongside Drizzt.~
@5    = ~Exciting? This is going to dampen our glory. I bet he'll take all the credit when this is over.~
@6    = ~Come friends! Let us be off.~
@7    = ~This is surely a mistake. Oh dear, oh dear, why can't we just get along?~
@8    = ~This is a good man you force us into fighting! Gods, forgive <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@9    = ~You chose the wrong enemy, drow.~
@10   = ~To battle, my friends!~
@11   = ~Did you not know who this was at the time, <CHARNAME>? Maybe we can talk this out.~
@12   = ~A geas is so forceful. The idea of being so heavily bound even by magic would make myself uncomfortable if this was asked of me.~
@13   = ~How is that possible? I know he is a powerful mage, but...~
@14   = ~I am so glad we did not have to hurt my kin of the deep.~
@15   = ~Eh, won't lie. Kind of glad we didn't have to hurt these fellows. Nice to see the little guy come out okay for once.~
@16   = ~Farewell, dark ones.~
@17   = ~I am so sorry kin. Please forgive me, Garl.~
@18   = ~Duth nada, duth nada!~
@19   = ~From all that he describes...he may be describing the aboleth. Such a terrifying thing...I don't think we should risk keeping it waiting.~
@20   = ~Pfeh. The thing in the tank? Up to <CHARNAME>, but the dwarf is probably off his rocker if you ask me.~
@21   = ~That would be a foolish. I sense a troubling power from that tank. Do as the duergar suggests...for the sake of our work here.~
@22   = ~No, no, no. This is such a horrible thing to do. No matter the price, no gain could be worth it.~
@23   = ~A demon from the lower planes? I wonder what the plan is with him.~
@24   = ~For battle, what else, girl? This mage we be chasing has an unusual plan in place.~
@25   = ~I want to hope we can just talk to him without hurting him. I know it holds such risk, but I would prefer to try.~
@26   = ~Oh my. I am not comfortable with this at all.~
@27   = ~A hopeful dream. But I hope it is one that comes true.~
@28   = ~Oh, I do not like this. But if we must play their game and their rules to survive, so we must.~
@29   = ~I would admire his ship, if I was not so afraid for Lantan. I wonder if the schematics to build this were stolen from my home.~
@30   = ~I...have no desire to watch this.~
@31   = ~What a cruel fate to bring upon them. Please, do not let these traits of the drow become a part of you.~
@32   = ~<CHARNAME>?!~
@33   = ~I hope they make it. I will pray for them.~
@34   = ~I hope they make it, slim as it may be. I will pray for them.~
@35   = ~Oh, I'm glad its free, but I hope you can us out of her wrath.~
@36   = ~Most people I think would have kept such a thing. I am surprised you were willing to give this up, too.~
@37   = ~I am so sorry. I do not want to fight you. But I do not know how to stop these.~
@38   = ~Oh, I need to write all of this down for reference later. It is so odd to see my writing hand so much...bigger than normal.~
@39   = ~I am so amazed we were able to do this for this beautiful silver. I had feared our quest was impossible.~
@40   = ~I fear no apology will stop her wrath. The consequences of our actions await.~
@41   = ~Even down here, you are still my kin. And no one should know the grief from losing their child.~
@42   = ~I am glad we found his child. I just wish I could properly tell him that, being a drow feels so...awful.~
@43   = ~*Sigh*. And the passage that follows is sure to run with innocent, angry blood of kin.~
@44   = ~Well. This is going to go exactly as we think it will.~
@45   = ~Da willen, da willen!~
@46   = ~What you did was cruel. But at least...he knows he passed. Better to know than to wonder.~
@47   = ~To see the home of my own deep kin. It is so rare for us to encounter one another. I should get my book ready.~
@48   = ~It is a bunch of rocks, gnome. Hardly record-worthy material, but I suppose you would have interest in the most mundane of things.~
@49   = ~<CHARNAME>, please. These are my deep kin! They did nothing to us.~
@50   = ~His mind is gone. Unless we restore it somehow, he is bound to his unpredictability insanity. Be careful, this could become violent.~
@51   = ~I am a bit curious on what lies beyond these dimensions. There is so much out there beyond our own world.~
@52   = ~I know it is difficult, but we have to pretend. Even if I hate it as well.~
@53   = ~I wish it were so easy. Being like this is harder than I thought.~
@54   = ~I know you are trying to keep up appearances but...oh, never mind.~
@55   = ~We are not here to cause trouble with you. I promise.~
@56   = ~With what we get into? That's not a promise you should be making, Recorder.~
@57   = ~What if you opened the chest first, good creature? By that method, you would not be violating your command.~
@58   = ~Sahuagin speech is so different than I imagined. The linguistics are completely unfamiliar to me.~
@59   = ~Oh no, I do not wish to be collared. I *will* not be collared.~
@60   = ~Oh, if it isn't Phelgrim's wife. She's wanted dead. Kill her and her friends for the reward!~
@61   = ~Wait, you're with Phelgrim's wife! You murdered him! Kill them all!~
@62   = ~Oh no. Are we stuck going through the Underdark after all?~
@63   = ~Some of the elves there have come into conflict with greedy locals of Amn who push too far in their grabbing of land. But else I know nothing else of them.~
@64   = ~I just hope these mad mages will listen to us. It just seems too likely that they would just harm us.~
@65   = ~Good luck.~
@66   = ~Oh dear. I will follow whatever path you take, <CHARNAME>. But I cannot deny that my preference is on the surface.~
@67   = ~I would be willing to leave on my own, for Imoen's sake. I could rejoin with my son and leave with him. I know I would miss recording the rest of your tale, but for Imoen's and Raban's sake, I am willing.~
@68   = ~You should remember Recorder. Do you recognize her, Imoen?~
@69   = ~I do not think she understands. Look at her eyes. She seems so distant, as if peering at something else entirely.~
@70   = ~This poor minstrel. The weave is to dangerous if you are too ambitious, but to lose all of your wits, I could not imagine it.~
@71   = ~Oh, what happened to you, Tiax? Though I suppose this fate was inevitable for you.~
@72   = ~Tiax? Oh the poor gnome must have been really ruined by Urdlen to end up like this.~
@73   = ~She is just a child. She shouldn't be in here, no matter her gift or curse.~
@74   = ~You are Rebecca, aren't you? Phelgrim's girl. If you are as foolish as you seem, he is in the room behind me.~
@75   = ~Or are you here for some other damnable reason?~
@76   = ~We are here for Phelgrim.~
@77   = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I paid your door guard for a meeting with you.~
@78   = ~I am <CHARNAME>. Saemon Havarian suggested I speak with you.~
@79   = ~<CHARNAME> is my name. I was referred by Captain Golin.~
@80   = ~Then go on ahead. But I would not do it if I were you.~
@81   = ~We're happy to see everyone free from that place. But...if there is one thing, <CHARNAME> is trying to find a way into spellhold.~
@82   = ~I'm so glad you are okay, Claire. I thought we would be too late.~
@83   = ~Rebecca? What are you doing here? Do you know what happened to my husband? Please, I need to find him.~
@84   = ~Wait! Ellie, it is me, Rebecca.~
@85   = ~Rebecca? I thought you were dead, girl, after that incident with Phelgrim. I...Sorry, FALSE ALARM. JUST THE SHADOWS!~
@86   = ~You know this person, Ellie?~
@87   = ~Of course I do! What are you doing here, girl? Galvena will torture you, kill you, or turn you in to Phelgrim.~
@88   = ~<CHARNAME> can explain better, but we are trying to help Claire.~
@89   = ~Wait, is that you, Rebecca? I thought you were dead, girl, after that incident with Phelgrim.~
@90   = ~Of course I do! What are you doing here, girl? Galvena will torture you, kill you, or turn you in to Phelgrim~
@91   = ~Well, if it isn't my performer. I know very well what happened with Phelgrim. We'll have two examples to make now.~
@92   = ~You will not touch me, or Claire! <CHARNAME> will see that your slaving days come to an end.~
@93   = ~If it isn't Phelgrim's little wife, soon former wife. He wishes to see you dead and I will deliver your head as a trophy, gnome!~
@94   = ~Rebecca, what are you doing here? I thought you were gone from this place?~
@95   = ~I was, but...it is a long story, Ginia. Why are you crying?~
@96   = ~I've not met my quota for the guild, Rebecca. You know how it is if you come up empty handed.~
@97   = ~Oh dear. Is there someway we can help?~
@98   = ~Chremy is threatening me, Rebecca. But maybe I should start from the beginning, for your friends.~
@99   = ~I...hate that we are doing nothing for her. She was a friend to me in the past. This makes me feel horrible.~
@100  = ~It is moments like this that remind me how incredible you are to people, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for doing this to her.~
@101  = ~I wish we could get all of these people out. Honestly? This island is a really terrible place.~
@102  = ~Farewell Rebecca. Take care of yourself.~
@103  = ~I'm so glad you're finally free of this place, Ellie.~
@104  = ~A slaving cook is definitely not where an old woman should be!~
@105  = ~Thank you, girl. Take care of yourself, and get out of here as soon as you can.~
@106  = ~Oh, I think being on this land is more terrifying than the boat.~
@107  = ~I told you that you could talk to me about it. You're too withdrawn for your own good sometimes, Recorder.~
@108  = ~I promise we will. Everyone will finally be free from this horrible place.~
@109  = ~Oh dear. Chremy is still here? He is...a terrible man.~
@110  = ~Well, bless my eyes. Aren't you the music girl that used to work here?~
@111  = ~No, I think you are mistaken. I'm sorry.~
@112  = ~Oh, you are! You flinch away just like I remember. Rebecca, yes?~
@113  = ~*Sigh*. Yes...I didn't mean to lie. I am just...being cautious.~
@114  = ~I do not know why you are back here. Unless you seek to somehow appease Phelgrim, little gnome, I would flee as far as you can.~
@115  = ~Rebecca, you aren't here to ask for your job, back are you? You ought to keep your freedom.~
@116  = ~No. We are here about Claire. Can you help us?~
@117  = ~Oh, I don't know if I should talk about that. Especially to you dear, you ought not to be looking for trouble as a free gnome.~
@118  = ~I know as well as you do how cruel the life is. Please, tell us about Claire.~
@119  = ~Well...all right dear. I do owe you for your kindness when I was first set to work in this place.~
@120  = ~My friend truly needs Claire's help. And...I do know how cruel Galvena is. Please, tell me if what I fear is true.~
@121  = ~Oh, you were once one of us. I...well all right.~
@122  = ~I think I've heard of you. You were the performer that was bought by Phelgrim right before I came here.~
@123  = ~Er, um...maybe I am?~
@124  = ~You are horrible at bluffing, gnome.~
@125  = ~Phelgrim has his men looking for you. Best you find somewhere on this island to hide. In fact, I don't think I should be seen with you, as he is still good friends with Galvena. I could be punished if we're caught like this.~
@126  = ~Rebecca, what are you doing here? Don't let Galvena see you, she'll drag you right back to work here.~
@127  = ~And lose my tongue? You ought not to be looking for trouble as a free lady, you'll just be put right back to work here.~
@128  = ~Well, all right, good lady. I'll talk.~
@129  = ~Please, it's just a few pirates. Nothing that can get in our way of our destination.~
@130  = ~What does she mean by awakened? I don't like this...~
@131  = ~Damn I don't like this lady. What is she playing at?~
@132  = ~That just seems cruel. You would only discourage them from giving others kindness.~
@133  = ~So? Not my problem. You could probably pull it off yourself. Your nose is a little big, but I think you're teachable.~
@134  = ~I'm sorry, but I have no interest in that. Please, just leave me alone.~
@135  = ~Spellhold? But that is on...no, not there.~
@136  = ~Excuse me gnome, but we are trying to listen to the woman here.~
@137  = ~Sorry, never mind me.~
@138  = ~Hey, are you okay, Recorder?~
@139  = ~Oh. The Shadowmaster is so different from what I expected. Even a little handsome.~
@140  = ~Pfft. You have better even in your own party.~
@141  = ~You poor child. This is not a life for you.~
@142  = ~Oh this room makes me feel so ill. Can we...move on, please?~
@143  = ~I'm going to leave my journal near the exit, just in case. But I will stand with you.~
@144  = ~Oh dear. I have a horrible feeling about this...~
@145  = ~Surely there is something? Some spell or another, to at least buy you time for proper healing?~
@146  = ~There is nothing. Ask your questions quickly, my time is short.~
@147  = ~I wish you wouldn't do that. But if you think it will help...~
@148  = ~I hope his family is still alive...or that it hasn't been too long. The poor man.~
@149  = ~He lives, and is sane at that! That alone gives him a chance to put things back together.~
@150  = ~I'm coming home, my family.~
@151  = ~<CHARNAME>, please no!~
@152  = ~I will get back to my family!~
@153  = ~Please, we mean no harm. We aren't even demons. We just are curious about a few things.~
@154  = ~Unable? It must be truly grievous then, if you call for aid for a duty you cannot fulfill.~
@155  = ~The imprisoned one...I can't recall any mention of this in the records we had in our temple. I'm afraid I can't offer any insight of my own.~
@156  = ~<CHARNAME>, please, don't do this!~
@157  = ~I would be happy to help my Underdark kin. I am sure we can be of assistance.~
@158  = ~I feel somewhat guilty that we deprived him of what he wanted. He...could do nothing. He changed, even.~
@159  = ~After all he supposedly did, Recorder? I think he did not deserve much of anything.~
@160  = ~Fish men? Perhaps he speaks of the Kuo-toa? What could they be doing in such a place?~
@161  = ~We have to stop that man this time. I don't think I can stand another murder in the detail he does them.~
@162  = ~Oh <CHARNAME>, this is such evil that you have done. I can't believe it.~
@163  = ~I...feel bad for the instrument. Oh, the poor thing will probably never sound the same.~
@164  = ~Again, sorry for the smell.~
@165  = ~Do we have to fight like this? I disagree with <CHARNAME>'s decision, but...~
@166  = ~Jaheira, I loath his decision, but it is not worth his life!~
@167  = ~Stay out of this! This is between myself and <CHARNAME>!~
@168  = ~I feel a bit embarrassed with all of this recognition. This was really all thanks to <CHARNAME>...~
@169  = ~I did not know the Djinn were so...selfish. But I suppose many creatures think of themselves first with little empathy.~
@170  = ~I'll make a note of what he says, maybe it will make a fine song.~
@171  = ~If there was more time, I would offer to help. I have so many note I could share with you.~
@172  = ~They are just normal streets like this and um...<CHARNAME>, how much longer is he going to talk like this?~
@173  = ~<CHARNAME>, this feels so unnecessary.~
@174  = ~To arms, militia!~
@175  = ~Surely there is no need to be so rude, kin? We are j-~
@176  = ~Djinn holding the town hostage over a Rakshasa? I hope we can do something about that.~
@177  = ~I am so glad we could help them. People can rest easy here now.~
@178  = ~We...can we really just leave her here? It seems cruel...and she seems so trustable.~
@179  = ~A corrupted temple of Amaunator? How troubling. The god's faithful has truly waned.~
@180  = ~This makes sense now. Blood itself can be the key to many things. The cowled wizards are truly corrupt.~
@181  = ~That...was all they had left from her, and you demanded it for free? *Sigh*. Sometimes...I wish you were more considerate.~
@182  = ~That was mutually beneficial for everyone. Except for the poor chicken.~
@183  = ~Thank you once again, kindly folk.~
@184  = ~I don't know if that was very responsible.~
@185  = ~Bah, nonsense. Let them have their fun. Good for a child to fight and drink, I say.~
@186  = ~I hope we are not too late to save this boy. Please, let us hurry.~
@187  = ~Myths have a way of always mixing in with the truth. I believe we will have to look beyond these first guesses to find the true source.~
@188  = ~I do not mind helping a fellow academic, her work could be very enlightening. But we should not forget why we are here, too.~
@189  = ~To know that I will have to write about this...oh <CHARNAME>, do you even know what you do?~
@190  = ~We...we should have tried harder. To see another child lost, it just breaks my heart all over again.~
@191  = ~We killed a bloody dragon! It was costly, but worth it. The child will be remembered when we retell the tale in all the glory!~
@192  = ~Thank you for your sympathies gnome but...excuse me.~
@193  = ~Your sympathies mean nothing! Out!~
@194  = ~This will make a great big place in the records. I am so proud of us!~
@195  = ~I am glad we could reunite him with his child. I just hope they will stay that way.~
@196  = ~Let us hurry. The longer the child is not back with their father, the more I worry it will be too late.~
@197  = ~This is wrong. We can't just kill her like this.~
@198  = ~Please. She deserves it anyway.~
@199  = ~Are you done bickering? I tire of listening. Kill me already.~
@200  = ~Why are we treating these poor people like this? I hope this was just a severe mistake in judgment, <CHARNAME>.~
@201  = ~You will pay for this, I swear.~
@202  = ~It is odd to hear of a town beset by creatures like this, even by druids. It is just not normal.~
@203  = ~Can you give an example or two? I would love to know more for my records.~
@204  = ~Oh this will be very intriguing. I have my book ready to quill everything down as we see it. So few get the opportunity...~
@205  = ~I definitely don't think you should do that, Recorder. By how reluctant they were in the first place, we are not quite trusted here. A pity really, we're quite behaved people!~
@206  = ~I still remember how awful that halfling was to me sometimes. I don't know why we are helping him, but I admit I am curious.~
@207  = ~I don't approve of us helping this man, but I admit I am curious.~
@208  = ~The Harpers, as mysterious and...sometimes distrusted they are, do good things. I don't think we should help this man.~
@209  = ~I think angering the Cowled Wizards is a terrible idea. What have we gotten ourselves into?~
@210  = ~Only if you use magic. Good old blade warriors like us? Less to worry about. Let's take care of this fellow, should be simple enough, eh?~
@211  = ~Ugh. I thought I was done with this human for good.~
@212  = ~I see you still have that miserable elf around, <CHARNAME>. Have your ears burst from her shrilling complaining? I assume as much.~
@213  = ~Heehee, I guess it all worked out. Beauty truly is in the eye of the perceiver.~
@214  = ~I do not like this. We should free her. We can get money in better ways.~
@215  = ~We should free her. We shouldn't even be thinking about engage in ransoming like this.~
@216  = ~The law is harsh here on such things...oh this is such a private matter, I don't feel comfortable listening. I'll not put this in the records.~
@217  = ~I know he would have been helpful for your cause. But allowing their family to regain the strength is a far greater thing.~
@218  = ~Why did we have to help him with this? This feels so wrong.~
@219  = ~But h- *sigh*. Never mind me.~
@220  = ~More senseless murder. It is harder and harder to record this...~
@221  = ~Anomen! She...she was innocent!~
@222  = ~Please. This sets the scales equal. Such is what revenge demands.~
@223  = ~Her mind is so addled. I cannot make any sense out of anything she has said so far on our journey.~
@224  = ~Oh dear, oh dear. I don't like this at all.~
@225  = ~Oh I worry for her too, Jan.~
@226  = ~Githyanki? What do you want with the Hidden? Maybe we could talk this out still?~
@227  = ~No words! Fight!~
@228  = ~A mind flayer? What are its plans? I suppose we will never know.~
@229  = ~That...was definitely not an expected sight. This can't be anything good.~
@230  = ~What the hell did I just see?~
@231  = ~Remember, say a word, and I will kill you.~
@232  = ~Such a monster. I would never let anyone do that to my child.~
@233  = ~That name makes me shiver. Vaelag gives a very bad name to gnome-kind.~
@234  = ~Finally. He can know peace. I will make a record about this. This poor child won't be forgotten.~
@235  = ~Thank you, thank you!~
@236  = ~Why would anyone do this to a child? That thief should be sent to the garrison.~
@237  = ~<CHARNAME>, this child isn't able to pass on. Please...please show a bit of sympathy.~
@238  = ~Oh no. No no no no.~
@239  = ~Oh dear, he's transforming. <CHARNAME>, why?~
@240  = ~Give me little man!~
@241  = ~I much prefer the brighter path, <CHARNAME>. I do not think I could bear to walk a darker path.~
@242  = ~That isn't so bad at all. I hope we can get to him in time.~
@243  = ~This feels awful. I don't know if I can stomach doing such a thing.~
@244  = ~He ain't all innocent, Recorder. Be like taking down any monster. Long as he somewhat deserves what is coming...I be fine with this path.~
@245  = ~Oh dear. I can't shake off the feeling that we are going to regret this.~
@246  = ~Please, think this through. Doing this...I think it would be the wrong choice.~
@247  = ~I can't put it together...but the night, and her here...I just wish I could give a name to why this is all so very worrying.~
@248  = ~This is confusing. But I am also glad we aren't doing this.~
@249  = ~Troubling. I am glad we were able to prevent your death.~
@250  = ~I know what it is like to...lose a child. I'm so sorry. I wish the world was not so cruel.~
@251  = ~I wish you weren't so rude in front of children like that. They are very impressionable. It's important we are kind.~
@252  = ~Nay, best they are toughened. The brat won't survive a minute without knowing how hard the world is.~
@253  = ~I am so glad we could do this for the paladin and the girl. They will be good for each other.~
@254  = ~Maybe we should have worked harder to try to get him the real thing. We've truly insulted him.~
@255  = ~Oh, it doesn't matter. He was asking for an arm and a leg, practically.~
@256  = ~Losing a child is...so hard. I'm glad that we at least got to help the poor boy find rest.~
@257  = ~Whatever your reason, Viconia, I will definitely make sure to record this little kindness of yours.~
@258  = ~No. We won't let you get away!~
@259  = ~My work shall not be lost!~
@260  = ~I'm so glad we stopped him. I just wish he wasn't... maddened by Urdlen, as we say in our culture.~
@261  = ~<CHARNAME>, please. Please do not stand by in their time of need. Please do not be greedy.~
@262  = ~I was worried the arts had fallen in the quality and passion being put forth. It's a relief to know it's a cause of something else.~
@263  = ~Thank you for trying to help them. Anything that we can do to assist the arts here is a very good thing for the city.~
@264  = ~This could be a wonderful opportunity. Maybe you could even get the playhouse's reputation turned around.~
@265  = ~I can't look...oh, I wish we weren't letting him just die.~
@266  = ~What a pretty little gnome you are. You could make quite the business with the little folk, if you know what I mean.~
@267  = ~Um, thank you...but I am happy as I am.~
@268  = ~Such a beauty. Sure you desire a bit of companionship this lonely <DAYNIGHT>?~
@269  = ~Um, no thank you. I should be going.~
@270  = ~You are from the Oghma temple in the docks, yes? Siria, was it?~
@271  = ~No, I am sorry, that is my mother.~
@272  = ~Well, tell her I am waiting for her, have a form for her to finish regarding the building.~
@273  = ~I'll remind her when I get the chance. Thank you.~
@274  = ~This is...the foul kin who murders children. We can't let him get away.~
@275  = ~Kill them, heehee, die!~
@276  = ~Oh dear. Who would...I don't even want to picture it.~
@277  = ~This...this was practically murder. What have you done, <CHARNAME>?~
@278  = ~I do not like this. He says to us to not murder, and yet to kill him would be just that. Who would not resist this?~
@279  = ~Their rehabilitation work, as I have understood from others and reports could take years. There have been very few who have ever left their confines and are known even to the Oghma faithful.~
@280  = ~This nay be someone needing rehabilitation, bard. Guiltless. Am nay surprised the government will do naught.~
@281  = ~We shouldn't get ourselves killed...but maybe there is a way to talk this through and not get my fellow gnome arrested as well.~
@282  = ~Despite his dangerous enemy threat, I think we will be okay.~
@283  = ~I...um, don't know if this is wise. People are going to think less of us now.~
@284  = ~Let the rivvil think as they will, gnome. There is no need to shiver in fear.~
@285  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is no reason to be so cruel to the child.~
@286  = ~Please, children's tears are just manipulative. I'm shocked you don't know that, being child-size.~
@287  = ~I'll not speak up, then...and let <CHARNAME> emulate your example then, Vienxay.~
@288  = ~Thank you for agreeing to help him. I've never been out to the Umar Hills, I wonder if there is any rich history of the place to be learned?~
@289  = ~History? You put your interest in some dull things there, Recorder.~
@290  = ~I have never heard of anything described like this before. These poor creatures...they must be decades, maybe even centuries old, and yet they are not undead.~
@291  = ~Jan Jansen! Oh dear, why do you say such ridiculous things?~
@292  = ~I suppose Garl might find your antics funny enough that Oghma shall not pass any angry judgment, but...*sigh*. Just be careful with what you say, Jan.~
@293  = ~Unbelievable. An avatar of some god...weakened by its lack of faith. I can't believe I am seeing this, I need to write this down. It explains so much.~
@294  = ~A wound in faith...Healing. Hope. These poor people, or creatures, or whatever name could be labeled upon them...they truly do not have any such thing in their being.~
@295  = ~Kangaxx...Kangaxx...it rings like a name that should be in our records, but I can't remember. What are you talking of, creature?~
@296  = ~Recorder? Not a creature to have conversation with! Prepare to defend yourself!~
@297  = ~Beholders are incredibly powerful, <CHARNAME>. Some of them have such power that their eyes can even turn creatures into stone. But a blind one? That is entirely unheard of. It's almost fascinating to think how that is even possible.~
@298  = ~Pfft, fascinating? I don't think we're thinking of the same word here, Recorder.~
@299  = ~Are you sure, Edwin? Netherese magic is very serious. I don't think you should do this.~
@300  = ~Let him cast it. I want to see him miserably fail.~
@301  = ~I am so happy for you, Cernd. But shouldn't you...raise him yourself?~
@302  = ~My calls and responsibilities ask too much of me, Recorder. If you desire my company again, visit me once I have things settled at the grove with my child.~
@303  = ~Become unseeing! Become one with the true god!~
@304  = ~How troubling. His eyes are just...gone.~
@305  = ~I wish...I wish I could truly get her to understand the depths of my love.~
@306  = ~Um, I do not know if you want advice, mister, but...perhaps a song? Pour your feelings into poetry and let it come out from your own heart in music.~
@307  = ~Yes...yes I should write that down. What an idea...~
@308  = ~You are not ugly, kin. Beauty comes from confidence and your own heart. Believe in yourself, and a little bit in Garl, for his humor has its way, and I think he would love to see such a coupling occur.~
@309  = ~You are kind, milady. Thank you!~
@310  = ~We should be very careful, <CHARNAME>. I'd prefer we didn't do this at all but...I guess it could be worse.~
@311  = ~I am glad he is free. Maybe he'll um, not take up the life of a thief anymore...~
@312  = ~Free! Free at last.~
@313  = ~Her smile is so bright. I just hope she can find her mother.~
@314  = ~Bah, she ought to leave her if she's that useless. I'd never leave my kids roofless.~
@315  = ~Thank you kind one!~
@316  = ~I am not averse to assisting, but the dead keep many secrets. He may not be telling us everything.~
@317  = ~I know you said that to avoid confrontation...but the darker gods are watching, and its not the attention I'd like.~
@318  = ~Perhaps I'll find some others...~
@319  = ~The less we support thieves, the better off the docks will be.~
@320  = ~Oh dear.  Forgive me if I will have no part in this guild's running, even if am mildly curious how its operations work. We have very few texts about thieves in the temple, they're always the ones that get stolen.~
@321  = ~I don't like this, <CHARNAME>. Helping criminals like this makes me really uncomfortable.~
@322  = ~Hrm, well, it's not ideal...but as long as we don't end up murdering people. That would be bad.~
@323  = ~I see you are traveling with company, miss Recorder.~
@324  = ~I am, yes. I am recording more of <CHARNAME>'s journeys, as I did before.~
@325  = ~Be careful, for in your very own records, you have illuminated the dangers of such a person.~
@326  = ~I know. But with the knowledge I can bring, I know I can be of help.~
@327  = ~Perhaps, perhaps not. Fate will tell if you have learned well from the lessons we have taught you.~
@328  = ~The Cowled Wizards are proud, and will most likely keep chasing this man. They are cold and unmerciful, even to the innocent.~
@329  = ~Ah, Recorder. I trust the knowledge that you have gained on your journeys has been worth the experience?~
@330  = ~Yes. I cannot wait to contribute everything that I have learned to the church when I can.~
@331  = ~What a wonderful thing you have do, <CHARNAME>. They have a hopeful chance now.~
@332  = ~Eh, if they wound up behind bars once...always a risk it could happen again.~
@333  = ~Then go away. Althkata has enough bullies.~
@334  = ~An enchanter...or some creature well capable of such? I have so many more questions, but he has been here far too long.~
@335  = ~How interesting. A magical puzzle. I wonder how they set this up...and why?~
@336  = ~Who cares? Let us either solve it quickly or get out of this slime. This place is not for me.~
@337  = ~Heh, I thought the sewers were perfect for one of yer station, elf.~
@338  = ~I'm glad we helped her, but without any coins given to her, I'm really worried. They'll just enter the streets now, poor, and starving..~
@339  = ~Come on, be easy on <CHARNAME>, eh? Fact is, the girl is free. Rest is up to her, whether she was given money or not.~
@340  = ~Thank you! Bye!~
@341  = ~What a horrible view! We won't let any of you escape, you cruel slavers.~
@342  = ~Die, fools!~
@343  = ~This reminds me of...no, I can't watch this! I can't.~
@344  = ~I feel as if we can trust him, Anomen. At the very least, he does not deserve this cage.~
@345  = ~This is a chance to really weaken the slave trade, <CHARNAME>. We should take this opportunity if we can~
@346  = ~I am so happy with what we did. Althkata will be a better place.~
@347  = ~Pfft, the detail that matters is this gets more fame and glory for us, woohoo!~
@348  = ~We...we are doing nothing? Please, I hope you reconsider.~
@349  = ~They must help themselves. He got himself into this cage, he can get himself out.~
@350  = ~Weren't you saved from a cage, Vienxay? I think you could use some compassion.~
@351  = ~I hope we can do this. No one deserves a life in the cage.~
@352  = ~Can is a definite. Will? Well, that's up to our leader, and I hope <PRO_HESHE> does!~
@353  = ~This is...so wrong. There must be something we can do to end this.~
@354  = ~I don't think I like this. We should take the high ground.~
@355  = ~I'd normally agree, Recorder, but he was really begging for a fight. I'd even lose my patience.~
@356  = ~Do you have to say something so...crude and awful?~
@357  = ~I can be showing you my sweet side, in one of the back rooms, lass.~
@358  = ~No. I do not want that at all, ever.~
@359  = ~I can't believe I was...party to such a terrible thing. I didn't speak up loud enough before but...this was a poor decision we made.~
@360  = ~If it helps to persuade her, I won't use any of the coins. I hate to um, pipe up like this, but this sounds serious. Can you tell us more about your issue, miss?~
@361  = ~No...No, no, no. Gods forgive us. We should have stopped him.~
@362  = ~A rock gnome? One of my own people? Oh dear.~
@363  = ~A planar traveling device? I've heard of attempts to recreate this in Lantan, but actual planar travel? This is very intriguing.~
@364  = ~Um, I don't like this <CHARNAME>. We should step with an abundance of caution.~
@365  = ~I feel sorry for him, despite the horrible thing he did. I can understand his pain, it is not easy to be a gnome here.~
@366  = ~Ugh, who cares? Ask him for the secrets to his power.~
@367  = ~<CHARNAME>, truly? This child needs help. Please, will you reconsider? It can't hurt to check and see what we can do.~
@368  = ~I'm so happy for the boy. Something good came out of this.~
@369  = ~I can't wait to tell papa everything!~
@370  = ~I trust in your leadership, <CHARNAME>, but I do not see the point of this. I hope you change your mind and give the key to her.~
@371  = ~Salamander Dust is a reagent with some regenerative properties. Even if salamanders aren't uncommon, it's quite difficult to gather.~
@372  = ~It's nice to have our own resource of knowledge with Recorder. A walking teacher, ha!~
@373  = ~Have you seen any or not?~
@374  = ~"There once was a gnome so smart,
With an invisible mask but an open heart.
The lies unknown will become told,
And the secrets will turn her world cold
and threaten to keep what was lost apart."~
@375  = ~Why...why are you saying that? What do you know?~
@376  = ~Sweet child, your kind heart and devotion to your work give you hope...but I see a child, and a confrontation with a man. The result of this will change your future forever. Be sure you are with friends.~
@377  = ~This...sounds really terrifying. I'll k-keep it in mind, though.~
@378  = ~A fairer gnome than any I have been blessed the sight of.~
@379  = ~Um...thank you?~
@380  = ~No, it is I who should be thankful. My heart beats for you, true beauty.~
@381  = ~Are you an aspiring bard? I've never been the recipient of something like this. I'm not sure what to say.~
@382  = ~Speak not, but sing. Your voice is like the angels, and your music like harmony engulfing me like buffets of wind from a strong wing.~
@383  = ~Are you asking for a performance?~
@384  = ~I would be blessed, no delighted, no enchanted to a- ow!~
@385  = ~Gustav! Why did you bite him?! I'm so sorry...I'm just going to leave you alone now.~
@386  = ~Alas! Blocked by a ferret. The pains of passion.~
@387  = ~Um...no thank you.~
@388  = ~Greetings, my <LADYLORD>. I am Madame Nin, and I am here to ensure you are pleasantly accompanied. Are you interested in companionship, my <LADYLORD>?~
@389  = ~Um, I don't think <PRO_HESHE> is interested in any thing so base and...immoral. Sorry!~
@390  = ~Yoshimo...how could you?~
@391  = ~Are you all right, <CHARNAME>? You seem almost ill.~
@392  = ~There's nothing wrong with me.~
@393  = ~I'm fine. Just... a bit dizzy.~
@394  = ~Something's not right. I think Irenicus did something to me.~
@395  = ~What did that wizard do? I do hope you are okay.~
@396  = ~They'll be just fine, Recorder! We are all here for <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@397  = ~If ye need healing, I'm here. And if ye need to give that bastard a beating, all the better.~
@398  = ~Well, hate to be the pessimistic one, but...this is shaping out to be quite the misadventure. We need to right our fortunes.~
@399  = ~Let us either achieve our revenge, or get out of this place, quickly.~
@400  = ~I have only heard stories of such creatures, appearing decades ago. To see something so terrible with my own eyes...how troubling.~
@401  = ~<CHARNAME>, what's wrong? You look so pale...please, let me get a cloth for you.~
@402  = ~Get away from me, I'm turning!~
@403  = ~It's coming again, Recorder! Run while you can!~
@404  = ~I feel... strange...~
@405  = ~What are you saying, <CHARNAME>? I- no, not again!~
@406  = ~This was...more terrifying than even before.~
@407  = ~If we do not find a way to restore you...I fear that this will not only end us, but you as well.~
@408  = ~<CHARNAME>, what are you intending with her? Are you um, interested in her? She is beautiful, but the tales of drow should be heeded, they are evil and dangerous.~
@409  = ~Sounds like someone is jealous.~
@410  = ~It's just a game, a way to gain a bit of trust. Nothing more.~
@411  = ~I might be. I don't think it's your business.~
@412  = ~I may sound that way, but I am also concerned, <CHARNAME>. Please, ease my worries.~
@413  = ~I do not know if that is a wise way to do that. I hope you do not push this too far, it could be very lethal.~
@414  = ~Truly? With...with someone like her, who just revels in such evil and despicable activities? *sigh* I truly hope you don't push this too far.~
@415  = ~My companion, Recorder.~
@416  = ~<CHARNAME>! You are back...~ [X3BLANK]
@417  = ~*Sigh* I can tell by your very expression what you did. Despite all the tales and their warnings, you let her touch you.~
@418  = ~I can't even look at you right now. My heart just wants to scream in frustration. Can we please, please, just go?~
@419  = ~That was short. I am so relieved. I was so worried.~
@420  = ~I am so happy. But this isn't a good place to be happy. Come, we should go.~
@421  = ~Recorder, the lorekeeper who has chronicled your tale while staying loyally by your side. She has given you the aid of her magical arts and music time and time again.~
@422  = ~Recorder, please, get out of here. I don't want to see you hurt.~
@423  = ~We may not come out of here for you to finish the tale of my adventure, Recorder.~
@424  = ~Irenicus awaits. Are you ready?~
@425  = ~You are kind. But I'm not leaving you.~
@426  = ~I am ready to face him. Besides, as silly as it is, all my writing would be in vain if I turned away and left you now. And I want to see this through.~
@427  = ~Recorder, the lorekeeper who has chronicled your tale while staying loyally by your side. She has given you her magic, her music, and then her undying love. She matches your gaze with a gentle one of her own.~
@428  = ~Recorder...~
@429  = ~I know. This may be the end. And it is possible that we may not all make it.~
@430  = ~But no matter what, Irenicus has to be stopped. And if that means my life, after all you have done for me, I am willing to give it.~
@431  = ~You have brought so much light into my life, hope, and happiness. I still remember when I was a slave, looking across Brynnlaw's shore and hoping for a savior. I want to believe I was looking across at you, then.~
@432  = ~And so I will stay by your side, my love. No matter what gets written, or if I am even the one to write the last passages of this tale, I am proud for what we are about to do.~
@433  = ~It is almost another lesson of Karsus, of the dangerous ambition that magic can inspire.~
@434  = ~I was in this beautiful library...so many books and tomes and musical harmonies I could not ever realize myself. But I had to come. I felt your need, <CHARNAME>. And so here I am.~
@435  = ~Every story ends one way or another. But your ending I wrote before we even came here, and I will see it realized.~
@436  = ~Have you read your own story, <CHARNAME>? I've recorded much of your time around Baldur's Gate, and am curious if you've ever seen the text for yourself.~ [X3Blank]
@437  = ~I've never seen it anywhere to read it, Recorder.~
@438  = ~Too many things have been happening to even think about that.~
@439  = ~No, but I would like to if I had the chance.~
@440  = ~I captured as much as I could. The journey into Nashkel's mines fighting kobolds, sneaking into a bandit camp, delving and stopping the Iron Throne's operations in the Cloakwood and Baldur's Gate, and then bringing down Sarevok himself. That you managed to do all of this...it was an honor to put it to paper.~
@441  = ~Still, after all of that, there are not many people that recognize you. I guess the city is so large it can make even you become a stranger to it at first.~
@442  = ~An advantage, perhaps, but not one that will be likely to last.~
@443  = ~In time my deeds here will carry weight. Then they will begin to see me.~
@444  = ~I'm not much interested in idle talk. Not when there's much to do.~
@445  = ~I guess that makes sense. If it were brighter times, I would give you a proper tour. There is so much beauty in the city. You'll find it's not at all like Baldur's Gate.~
@446  = ~I thought you were from Lantan?~
@447  = ~You are from Athkatla then Recorder?~
@448  = ~I would like that sometime.~
@449  = ~In time, maybe. It would be nice for more people to know about some of the great things you did in Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast. It would give people more hope.~
@450  = ~In truth, I am not sure I would want the attention.~
@451  = ~That could bring me danger. I've already had my taste of those who have less than good intentions with me.~
@452  = ~Enough with the babbling, Recorder.~
@453  = ~Sorry. I will just stop talking, then.~
@454  = ~I was born in Lantan, but after my parents separated, Amn became my new, second home. The city is always bustling and crowded, but I've grown to love all that it has to offer, especially the theater.~
@455  = ~The shows there are always so wonderful. I know our priority is our adventures but if there is time, I would say we should even go see one. I think everyone would like it.~
@456  = ~You would? I would show you some of the best sights. The theater is my favorite place. Mother always said I spent a little too much time, but I love the performances. I think you would too.~
@457  = ~Oh, stop giving me those eyes, Gustav, you aren't getting dinner. Sometimes taking care of is is just like taking care of a baby.~ [X3Blank]
@458  = ~You have experience with children, Recorder?~
@459  = ~He is as cute as his owner.~
@460  = ~I don't think Ferrets and babies are the same thing.~
@461  = ~I'm sure the Ferret won't mind a snack.~
@462  = ~Can you not talk to your animal like a crazy gnome?~
@463  = ~Uh, no of course not, no, not at all!~
@464  = ~You seem a little defensive.~
@465  = ~Is everything all right? I was just making a joke.~
@466  = ~Well, we have things to get on to.~
@467  = ~Oh, I know that, <CHARNAME>. I know that perfectly well.~
@468  = ~Okay, okay. One. And you can thank nice <CHARNAME> for that. One small piece of meat here, but no more.~
@469  = ~He is so cute. Sometimes it reminds me of...well....~
@470  = ~Of...?~
@471  = ~You seem distant suddenly. Is everything alright?~
@472  = ~We can muse another time. We should move on.~
@473  = ~*Sigh*. Sorry, <CHARNAME>. I'll try to mind myself better.~
@474  = ~I'm not being defensive. I am just...~
@475  = ~Nothing. It's nothing. I was just...~
@476  = ~I understand, I will j- Gustav! How did you get into the food bag when I wasn't paying attention? You are such a handful sometimes.~
@477  = ~Gustav! How did you get into the food bag when I wasn't paying attention? *Sigh*, let me talk later, <CHARNAME>. I have a formerly hungry now quite fed Ferret to take care of.~
@478  = ~Are you flirting with me to convince me to feed my ferret snacks he ought not to have? Fine, Gustav, just because we are apparently cute. But just one! Sometimes my ferret you remind me of...well...~
@479  = ~It's nothing, it's nothing. We're fine...we're fine.~ [X3Blank]
@480  = ~You seem a bit on edge, Recorder.~
@481  = ~What is it?~
@482  = ~Can you focus, Recorder? You're gazing off.~
@483  = ~I am sorry, I don't mean to cause concern. I'll be more focused as you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@484  = ~I am looking out for danger, in the corners and shadows. We've been ambushed before, I do not want to be caught unaware if I can avoid it.~
@485  = ~You seem almost paranoid about it though. You keep looking about every few minutes. Take it easy.~
@486  = ~I suppose that is fine, though we've handled everything fine so far.~
@487  = ~Well, keep it up, then. Give a signal if you see anything suspicious.~
@488  = ~Do not worry. I will keep you safe.~
@489  = ~Do I? I'm just trying to be careful, that's all. Do not worry about it, okay?~
@490  = ~I know, I just...I just have this feeling in my heart that is making me uneasy. I'm probably being paranoid. Just ignore silly me.~
@491  = ~Okay, <CHARNAME>. I just hope this is all nothing and it's just nerves.~
@492  = ~I know you will do your best, <CHARNAME>. I just wish that was enough to get these nerves to go away. Thank you, though, for trying to reassure me.~
@493  = ~This is all so very confusing.~
@494  = ~Is your name really Rebecca?~
@495  = ~Whoever has been sending these men, we know where to look for them now.~
@496  = ~What have you not been telling us, Recorder? This is the second time we've been attacked.~
@497  = ~We do. Maybe there, we will find some answers. But you do deserve to know the truth, or what I remember of it.~
@498  = ~...Yes. Once it was. But I don't remember her. I don't know why these people are after her.~
@499  = ~Why would you not know why these people are after you? You're still her.~
@500  = ~Please, explain if you would. I'm in the dark over here.~
@501  = ~It doesn't matter. No one messes with us.~
@502  = ~...I guess I have no choice now. I didn't want anyone to get hurt, or endangered.~
@503  = ~I was Rebecca. A different gnome, with a different story...one I have long left behind.~
@504  = ~I just want to be Recorder now. I didn't think they would still try to go after me and hurt us, I thought the last incident was it, but...~
@505  = ~I guess not even a scholar can just rewrite history to conveniently forget parts of herself.~
@506  = ~What did you do to make them so angry?~
@507  = ~Not at all. These men are persistent in getting you killed.~
@508  = ~You should have said something earlier. We could have gotten killed for it.~
@509  = ~All I did was want to be free. I was a slave, do you understand? Chained and starving, wanting to escape with the sole thing that mattered...~
@510  = ~I am sorry, very sorry, <CHARNAME>. But please understand I couldn't have seen this happening like this.~
@511  = ~I still feel guilty. I shouldn't have kept you in the dark. I didn't think it mattered, but I guess it does now.~
@512  = ~I don't want to talk about it more, not right now. Just...we need to stop whoever is sending the assassins. I fear that is the only way these attacks might stop.~
@513  = ~Can we talk now, <CHARNAME>? I've been eating myself alive on the inside on how to say this.~ [X3Blank]
@514  = ~Whatever answers you can provide on Phelgrim and these hunters, it would make things a lot more clearer.~
@515  = ~How can I know you will tell the truth? If things went your way we wouldn't know a thing about your past.~
@516  = ~Take a breath and speak when you are ready. I'll listen attentively.~
@517  = ~Forget it, Recorder, Rebecca, or whoever you are. I don't want to hear it.~
@518  = ~I was hoping you would be supportive. I need someone right now, and you deserved some answers. But...if you want to be cold and cruel, then I will just console myself.~
@519  = ~I don't know. At least, I don't know how to convince you that I am not making things up. But I hope you will at least listen.~
@520  = ~Years ago, when I had just become a young adult gnome, several of us were celebrating making our next steps in life, be it going to a bard's college, like myself, or apprenticing with the recluse mages of Orlil like my best friend at the time, Lizzie.~
@521  = ~It was a small celebration near the coastal waters. Away from parents and responsibility, a real party. There were about a dozen of us. It was a sweet moment.~
@522  = ~But then something odd was in the air. An illusion of sorts, that became foggier, and foggier, until suddenly all I saw was grey and heard a scream. When I tried to turn around, something hit me hard in the back of the head.~
@523  = ~These were pirates, the worst type of pirates, slavers. They weren't interested in ransom, only in using our skills and talents for free. Lantan periodically had issues with pirates at sea, but we've never heard of them docking and actually taking people from the beach, none of us were prepared.~
@524  = ~What does this have to do with Phelgrim?~
@525  = ~I'm sorry that happened to you. What happened next?~
@526  = ~Why didn't you tell me you were a slave when we first journeyed together back in Baldur's Gate?~
@527  = ~Gnomes, masters of illusions, got bested by illusionary magic? That's rather amusing.~
@528  = ~Enough. I don't want to listen to the rest of this. There's no time.~
@529  = ~I understand. Maybe it won't even matter. It's...easier for me not to talk about it anyway. It just brings back pain.~
@530  = ~I'll get to his part soon. I just...I just need to start before. Talking about him is...difficult for me.~
@531  = ~I couldn't have broken my appearance of Recorder, not to be the pitiful gnome girl, not after already losing my friend. Talking about this....it would have been too much.~
@532  = ~I don't know why you find it funny. Some of my friends tried to defend us and see through the illusion and fight back. We were twelve on the beach, but eight on the ship. Those who had tried to fight back... died.~
@533  = ~They took us out to an island called Brynnlaw. When we arrived, some of us were assigned as cooks, or to ships to build them devices, or cut gems, or work in their bordello. Sometimes it was just a rotation based on who had bought you.~
@534  = ~I was the musician sold to a bordello owned by a woman named Galvena to perform for waiting guests. They let me keep my flute to play it and I twirled and danced for pirates and thieves and murderers. I hated it and just wanted to go home, but there was no way off I could figure out yet, not without risking death or torture.~
@535  = ~But it was there a few weeks later that I met Phelgrim. He saw my dancing and playing and he was smitten. I didn't know about his history, he seemed like a nicer pirate, so seducing him brought me hope, just by looking his way, and conversing with him when he wanted, and going on walks with the oversight of the Bordello's guard, and for him, it made him want to keep me, to buy me for himself.~
@536  = ~What happened next?~
@537  = ~So you led him on?~
@538  = ~It sounds like you put yourself in this predicament, then.~
@539  = ~Phelgrim asked me if I would be happy with him, and I said yes. He bought me from the Bordello, and I became his slave and wife. I grew to understand what he did, that he was a pirate and slaver...~
@540  = ~But he was strong and offered protection, and I prayed maybe one day, he might offer me freedom.~
@541  = ~But...that never happened.~
@542  = ~So I understand how your relationship began. But how did things fall apart?~
@543  = ~If he cared for you, why did you hurt him?~
@544  = ~Honestly, from the sounds of it, Phelgrim did nothing wrong. There is more to this, isn't there? Tell me.~
@545  = ~It was that or know a life in the Bordello forever, a place I knew I could not escape on my own. None of my other friends had been put in there with me, and I wasn't as magically talented at the time.~
@546  = ~So I entertained Phelgrim's advances...I probably would have risked getting hurt if I refused them anyway. I didn't see any other choice. Even after understanding he was a pirate or slaver, when he mentioned his desire to purchase me, there was at least some hope in being his slave-wife he might let me be free someday.~
@547  = ~How can you say that? Never mind. Just...let me finish.~
@548  = ~That...is...hard to talk about. Can I...talk to you later about it? I'm not trying to avoid it...I just need more time.~
@549  = ~I understand Recorder. Take all the time you need.~
@550  = ~You can't keep avoiding this, Recorder. People have tried to kill us.~
@551  = ~If that is what you want, so be it.~
@552  = ~No, I want to hear it now.~
@553  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I promise, I will tell you the rest later. I just...I just need some time to gather my courage.~
@554  = ~I know you badly want details. And I want to tell you it's just...so hard. So really, really hard. Just give me time. I promise, I will tell you the rest later.~
@555  = ~I'm sorry for not being able to finish before. If you'll let me...I will tell you the rest now.~ [X3Blank]
@556  = ~You don't have to Recorder, if it bothers you.~
@557  = ~Please. I would be glad to hear it.~
@558  = ~Finally. Tell me the rest of this tale.~
@559  = ~Forget it. I'd rather not have another half of a half-story.~
@560  = ~I...I see. Then forget I said anything.~
@561  = ~It does bother me. But... I am a bard. We share stories of the past, no matter what happened, so their history can be remembered and learned from. My past shouldn't be any different.~
@562  = ~I told you that I was Phelgrim's slave and wife after he bought me from being a performer at the bordello. When he was in a good mood, he was a... good master, almost a husband, if that makes sense. Even if never released, maybe it would be okay to love him, I felt.~
@563  = ~He was quite busy for many months after, and I was in the midst of learning I was with his child. I hid it for as long as I could, because I was afraid of what he would say. I was afraid of what I would think too, if I acknowledged it. I never really knew how to process it all.~
@564  = ~He wasn't happy about it once I did tell him, but I tried my best to keep doing the housekeeping tasks he always had me do to keep his mood. I didn't want to lose the child from his rage.~
@565  = ~I named him Raban when he was born. Despite all the circumstances, he was a gift in a dark world for me.~
@566  = ~You were happy about him, even if Phelgrim was the father?~
@567  = ~What happened to the child, Raban?~
@568  = ~I'm guessing this light of hope didn't last long for you.~
@569  = ~Phelgrim is a monster. But Raban wasn't Phelgrim. Raban was purely precious.~
@570  = ~Not a few more years after he was born, Phelgrim's mood about him existing came to an explosion. He believed the child ruined his reputation, and that there was profit in selling him off to another slaver who was interested in him.~
@571  = ~There was some mining operation were his small size would allow him to get into small spaces to retrieve shiny ores and gems. And children were easy for them to get obedience out of and intimidate. It is not a good place.~
@572  = ~He was...kind in his own way tough, and let me have one last night with Raban before he gave him away. I was distraught, and knew no matter how impossible, I had to try to get him away from this life. To not be free...to have no one around him to be loved by, I couldn't let it happen.~
@573  = ~I snuck out that night. I had never tried to run before, but the talk had made me feel so defiant...that it was okay to die if he could be free. We were going to board this small skiff just a short away from the house, and row anywhere else.~
@574  = ~I take it that didn't go according to plan.~
@575  = ~That was brave of you.~
@576  = ~This is getting awfully winded.~
@577  = ~No...very, very far from it.~
@578  = ~I didn't consider myself brave. I still don't. Just so desperate, maybe even selfish. The only light I had in that unwanted world was about to be gone from me.~
@579  = ~I'm sorry. I just don't know how to tell it any other way except by...rambling it all out.~
@580  = ~Phelgrim caught us. He threw flaming powder at the Skiff that caused it to burst into flame, and his men approached us both. I remember the look in his eye. It was the same one he gave to others who crossed him, and that my fate was sealed.~
@581  = ~I drew a small knife. It was all I had to defend myself, but it wasn't to protect me. There was no surviving. The only hope was freedom. And I wanted to set Raban and myself free.~
@582  = ~I...I freed Raban. But before I could free myself, I was grabbed and bound and forced back into Phelgrim's captivity.~
@583  = ~That must have been a horrible choice you were forced to make.~
@584  = ~Why would you do that to your own son? Are you insane? Killing him isn't freeing him.~
@585  = ~How did you finally get away from him?~
@586  = ~I think I've enough of an understanding now. I don't want to hear the rest of this.~
@587  = ~It was the worst choice I ever made. I ... I hated myself so much for it afterwards. But I couldn't...I couldn't let Raban suffer such a life I was forced to have.~
@588  = ~I do not know if I want to tell the rest either...but thank you for listening to what I could manage. It makes the pain a little easier to carry.~
@589  = ~Phelgrim was furious over everything, but I refused to speak with him. My sentence was to be killed in front of all the other slaves the following morning.~
@590  = ~But Phelgrim got careless. Most of those in his employee were slaves. My cell guard was a solemn old man, and he sacrificed himself to get me into a barrel to pretend to be a ship's merchandise and into a ship that was headed into Amn.~
@591  = ~That is how I got to Althkata. The church of Oghma helped me get into contact with my mother...and saw us reunited.~
@592  = ~It took years for the nightmares to stop. I had forged a new identity and tried so hard to forget...you must think so poorly of me.~
@593  = ~Of course not, Recorder. Far from it.~
@594  = ~I don't know. Only the gods can really say.~
@595  = ~What you did was terrible. There had to be another way rather than taking your son's life.~
@596  = ~I was so worried you would judge me so poorly. I've...never shared that. But it felt good to get it off my chest. Thank you for listening.~
@597  = ~Maybe. When it is my time, and I go to our Golden Hills and Garl judges me, maybe then, I will know if I did the best decision. I just wish I saw a way where Raban could have lived and still been happy.~
@598  = ~I have pondered what would have happened if I did nothing...and I only see death or more years of abuse and slavery. No ending could have been a happy one for me. No such ending do I even deserve.~
@599  = ~I am sorry if I have seemed quiet lately, <CHARNAME>. I have never shared such personal knowledge before.~ [X3Blank]
@600  = ~I understand why you didn't before.~
@601  = ~I still think what you did was horrible.~
@602  = ~Are you all right?~
@603  = ~It is just...for all of this knowledge we have, I feel even worse for being hypocritical. I am a Lorekeeper, meant to hold such history close for sharing.~
@604  = ~And I didn't do that. I tried to forget something. I always speak of history, of remembering both the ill and good because we cannot forget who we are, or where we came from. But I was doing just that.~
@605  = ~Is that always the truth? There is some knowledge that is dangerous in the wrong hands.~
@606  = ~It is hypocritical of you. But now you can stop hiding.~
@607  = ~I would have done the same in your shoes, Recorder. You were only protecting yourself.~
@608  = ~I think you are justified for believing that. I think what I did was unforgivable, too.~
@609  = ~It can be, yes. Very dangerous. And yet if we do not know it is dangerous, how can we understand that it must even be shielded?~
@610  = ~Knowledge and history are key to our own advancement. The temple of Oghma advocates its access to everyone, and encourages bards to share their stories with the world, especially when they carry information that can help with life or a bit of wisdom.~
@611  = ~Here I am just going on about knowledge and philosophy. I hope I'm not boring you.~
@612  = ~No, I'm glad to listen to you, Recorder. I feel closer when we talk like this.~
@613  = ~A little. We have things we could be doing.~
@614  = ~Think nothing of it.~
@615  = ~I do not know if I can. Not because...I am afraid, but I have become so married to my own identity, I would feel uncomfortable breaking away from it. It is me now.~
@616  = ~I don't know if that makes any sense, but...that is how I feel.~
@617  = ~No, it is all right. I want you to open up to me, Recorder. I want to be close.~
@618  = ~I see, though there are things we should get to.~
@619  = ~Would you? Maybe I just have this image in my head of your heroics...but I do not think you would have. I think you would have faced everything head on. And I think you would have never put the knife at your own child like I did.~
@620  = ~Maybe I am just lifting you up on too high. I'm sorry if I sound like I am glorifying you so much.~
@621  = ~No, it is all right. I enjoy your fondness of me.~
@622  = ~I am just a <PRO_RACE>, Recorder. Nothing else.~
@623  = ~You're right. I would have handled it much better.~
@624  = ~Really? I do like you, <CHARNAME>. I hope that's not too odd sounding, heehee.~
@625  = ~You say that. But I know that you are far greater then that. If you do not know that yet, I think you will find out for yourself soon.~
@626  = ~I'm sorry, I won't trouble you with such silliness. We should keep moving as it is. I've distracted you with idle chatter long enough.~
@627  = ~You are kind. I am glad we are friends, and I am glad I opened up to you. It is odd, but sometimes I believe that I needed your companionship more than you need mine. But never mind that. We should continue on.~
@628  = ~The smell of the sea salt. All the ships moored at the harbor with pirates at every corner...This is definitely Brynnlaw, or a horrible nightmare.~ [X3Blank]
@629  = ~This was the place you were a slave?~
@630  = ~What are you talking about?~
@631  = ~You have been here before?~
@632  = ~I don't have time for your concerns. We are here for Irenicus and Imoen.~
@633  = ~Yes. This was the place where I was taken to from Lantan.~
@634  = ~I was a slave here. I told you about it a little bit. I-I was hoping I was somehow mistaken, that were I was taken was not the same place, but now that I see it, th-this is it. This is "home".~
@635  = ~Please, have us make our way as soon as possible. I really don't want to run into Phelgrim or his slavers if we can avoid it.~
@636  = ~That is what I intend to do anyway.~
@637  = ~Why not have us just kill this Phelgrim? I'm sure he is no threat to our entire group.~
@638  = ~Your past better not disrupt my task here, Recorder.~
@639  = ~I know you care for Imoen and are eager to track down Irenicus, but...*sigh*~
@640  = ~Maybe things will be just fine for once. We're so close to finding your friend and Irenicus, I don't want to be the cause of anything going wrong.~
@641  = ~I don't know where he is, and even if I did, he has dangerous henchman who serve beneath him. We're better off saving your friend than going after my husband.~
@642  = ~As- as if I would want that either, <CHARNAME>. Just...let us keep moving and hope as much for both our sakes.~
@643  = ~No! No no no no. J-Just as soon...as soon as I discovered that Raban was back in my life, I...I....~ [X3Blank]
@644  = ~(Hold her).~
@645  = ~I'm sorry.~
@646  = ~We tried everything we could.~
@647  = ~There's no time to mourn. Let's keep moving.~
@648  = ~Don't give up. There may still be a way to get him.~
@649  = ~Sorry? Sorry?! You...you let that *monster* keep him...and you think an apology is enough?!~
@650  = ~You don't have to apologize. I- I wish so many things could have been different.~
@651  = ~(She pushes your arms away) Don't touch me! Don't ever touch me again. You are a liar...you don't care for me at all.~
@652  = ~(She sobs in your arms for a while, pressing her face into your side.)~
@653  = ~You *tried*? You just practically handed him over. I trusted you!~
@654  = ~Just...keep moving? After what you did? You think it is so *easy* to just do that? I feel like Urdlen put his claws in my heart and pierced them with all the fury of his horrible hatred.~
@655  = ~Are you kidding me? Are you mocking me? You practically gave him to that *monster*. With you next to me there is no hope of doing something good for anyone else but yourself!~
@656  = ~I know you are trying to cheer me up, but I don't need that right now. I need to cry. I need...to let go. I let this happen, and I hate myself for it.~
@657  = ~I don't know if I'll be sticking around much longer. You aren't the person I thought you were, or maybe I was lying to myself. Just...just leave me alone.~
@658  = ~I know you have your own matters at stake that are incredibly dire. I just hope things end for you less horribly than they have for me.~
@659  = ~I feel like I have failed you. You saved my son, but in your moment of plight, I couldn't stop Irenicus from doing what he did to you.~ [X3Blank]
@660  = ~It's not your fault. There was nothing you could do.~
@661  = ~He will pay! I will destroy him for what he has done!~
@662  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Recorder.~
@663  = ~Please don't push me away, <CHARNAME>. I'll...drop it, but I'll be here, whenever you need someone to listen.~
@664  = ~I would caution letting that anger overwhelm you. Revenge is a dangerous endless cycle. We can find a way to stop him without compromising principles.~
@665  = ~He believes himself unstoppable. We can show him that he can be defeated.~
@666  = ~Thank you for your support, Recorder. I don't know how I would do this without you.~
@667  = ~Then let us get through this place and find him.~
@668  = ~Enough talking, then. Let us track him down.~
@669  = ~You are right, there was nothing. I have never seen or heard of such...such power before. Perhaps not since Karsus.~
@670  = ~But there is a comfort in that. Karsus grasped too much that was not just for himself. It is a lesson of arrogance of magic and power. I know we can found a way to stop him.~
@671  = ~It is the same support you gave me. As long as we hold each other up, we can do this.~
@672  = ~(She squeezes your hand.) It is the same support you gave me. Because we hold each other up, we can make it through this. I know we will.~
@673  = ~Let's make him regret ever trying to hurt us or our friends.~
@674  = ~(She squeezes your hand.) I'm with you. Let's make him regret ever trying to hurt us or our friends.~
@675  = ~That was the most terrifying experience, going through the Underdark like that. I do not think I ever want to do it again.~ [X3Blank]
@676  = ~Nor I, if I can help it.~
@677  = ~We still can't relax. We have more chasing to do.~
@678  = ~I know you're glad to be out, but this isn't the time for a chat.~
@679  = ~Let us see this finished first, then.~
@680  = ~I still haven't quite recovered from all of that. To go from finding my son, to a magical prison, and then into one of the most dangerous places in the realm...and into a drow city itself!~
@681  = ~We can't fail now. Not after all of that. But if something happens...for all that you've done for me, even as we haven't always got along...I want to show the world how much you have done for them, with you well and alive.~
@682  = ~Nothing will happen. I'll prevail against Irenicus.~
@683  = ~That may not happen if you don't make it through either.~
@684  = ~The winner will write the history, Recorder. We must win against him.~
@685  = ~We can't fail now. Not after all of that. But if something happens...for all that you've done for me, I will make sure the world remembers how much good you have done. How much you have touched me with your aid.~
@686  = ~That is the confidence we will need. He is admittedly terrifying, but I believe you can do this.~
@687  = ~Then I will make sure that I am standing next to you. I've made it through the Underdark, the Underdark! I know I can be there to the end.~
@688  = ~Yes, we must. Else the writing of history will take a very different, darker turn.~
@689  = ~I still haven't quite recovered from all of that. To go from losing my son again to a magical prison, and then into one of the most dangerous places in the realm...and into a drow city, no less.~
@690  = ~I have not forgiven you for your part in it. And I do not think I ever will. Sometimes I felt guilty for hoping we would both die down there.~
@691  = ~You wished me to die?~
@692  = ~Why are you even traveling with me, then?~
@693  = ~Like anything could stop me.~
@694  = ~Such was my loathing for you and myself, yes.~
@695  = ~I thought it was because where else would I reasonably go to? What would I do beyond find a corner to be gloomy in the temple? But it is out of duty I think, to the story, to seeing it to the end.~
@696  = ~You are powerful, <CHARNAME>. I think it is why you are still surviving despite what happened. But I do not know if you are responsible, and that is terrifying.~
@697  = ~It was petty to have those thoughts in the end. To hate you that way. Hatred doesn't do anyone any good..and you've tried to do well for me despite that day.~
@698  = ~One day you will understand that every decision I make is necessary, even the unpopular ones.~
@699  = ~I do not care if you loath me. Only that you follow.~
@700  = ~I hope someday you can forgive me.~
@701  = ~I do not know if you will listen, or care. But in some ways you aren't much different than this man we are pursuing. Even if we best him, your story may very well just end up as a warning to others, or worse, that few "heroes" are truly heroic.~
@702  = ~I know you hate me. But I hope someday you can forgive me.~
@703  = ~I hope I do not. I will never understand why you thought Raban was a negotiable piece, or forgive you for it. But I will follow you until this is over or you dismiss me.~
@704  = ~I will follow you until this is over, or you dismiss me. Once that happens...I will never be in your presence again.~
@705  = ~I don't think I can. But that doesn't mean I won't see this through, nor that at the end of this all, that I won't come around to it. But I would not have any hope that it will happen.~
@706  = ~When Raban disappeared in front of me forever, I hated you for it for a time, even if that wasn't fair to you. I too, failed him. And it is up to me to be strong enough to be of aid to see us through, to see Irenicus stopped, and not make another costly failure. We can't put all of that weight on you.~
@707  = ~Perhaps, though the weight of burden is still the greatest on myself. He has my soul, the consequences are greatest to me.~
@708  = ~Well, that's rather ungrateful of you. I tried my best to help Raban.~
@709  = ~Good. I am counting on you, Recorder.~
@710  = ~Maybe it is silly to hope for this, or even think this far...but when this is all done, when Irenicus is stopped and you are done traveling, maybe you could help me find Raban.~
@711  = ~I could try. I still am sad that you lost him.~
@712  = ~It would be difficult, Recorder. We don't even know where to look.~
@713  = ~I do not think I would be interested in that, Recorder.~
@714  = ~This is true. But even if we aren't very close, or haven't known each other very long...I want to do my best. I am tired of seeing people suffer because of what he has done, you included.~
@715  = ~It is petty of me, wrong even. Yet I still felt that way for a time. I am sorry for that, though I think I did my best in not letting you see just how angry I was.~
@716  = ~We'll support each other. As we always have, even through failure.~
@717  = ~Come, we can talk much, but there is only one way to see this through, and that is to keep going.~
@718  = ~I know we wouldn't even know the first place to look but...I just can't rest easy knowing he is out there somewhere.~
@719  = ~I...understand. It would be a goose chase at best, but...I can't rest easy knowing he is out there somewhere.~
@720  = ~Come, let us resume your journey. We still need to see this current travail with Irenicus through to the end.~
@721  = ~*Yawn*. It's time to go already? I feel so tired still.~ [X3RLS]
@722  = ~Did you not get any sleep?~
@723  = ~Are you ill? You do seem sluggish.~
@724  = ~We can rest a little more, if you need it.~
@725  = ~I'm afraid it's time to go, Recorder.~
@726  = ~Eugh. I'm exhausted, but I will try to manage.~
@727  = ~I couldn't stop having nightmares. Maybe it was just a curse of the creative mind, perhaps. I gave up after I woke up the second time and just joined the watch.~
@728  = ~That would explain why you joined me on watch. I thought you were just being nice.~
@729  = ~You know, I could help you sleep if you're tired next time. Damn, don't look at me like that! 'Twas just a joke.~
@730  = ~What was it about? Maybe talking about it will help.~
@731  = ~We can delay a little longer if you like. Adventuring tired won't help the others.~
@732  = ~It inconveniences us when you can't take care of yourself. Push through the dreams and get more rest next time.~
@733  = ~A "curse of the creative mind"?~
@734  = ~That is kind of you. But if we could just rest a little sooner, I think I will be fine for now.~
@735  = ~If you are sure, then the road awaits.~
@736  = ~I'll keep that in mind, then, a shorter march could do us all well.~
@737  = ~What were your nightmares about? Maybe talking about it will help.~
@738  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I hope the creatures out there are as considerate as you with my state, as unlikely as that will be.~
@739  = ~I saw old companions back in the Sword Coast, Sir Mark and the Oghma scholars...just lying about, in a river of blood, all from the stabs of a knife. And then I saw Raban, and he was looking at me with eyes as fear.~
@740  = ~And then when I looked at my own hand, I saw the weapon. I do not know if I want to wield a dagger anymore.~
@741  = ~It sounds like you are still blaming yourself, in your head, at least.~
@742  = ~I remember your old companions, at least Sir Mark. You weren't responsible for their deaths, either.~
@743  = ~It's just a nightmare. Don't let it bother you.~
@744  = ~There's no point in disregarding a weapon because of one nightmare.~
@745  = ~Of...of course. I'll ensure I'm not inconveniencing anyone anymore.~
@746  = ~It just means I tend to wander, thinking of music, or the days events, or the past. It's calming, but sometimes it can stir demons I'd rather not remember.~
@747  = ~Even after recreating my identity, I still feel so much guilt when I think of them. Do you not with friends and loved ones you've lost~
@748  = ~I'd rather not think about them right now.~
@749  = ~I do, admittedly. Even now I wish I could have saved their lives.~
@750  = ~I don't. Ultimately survival is their own responsibility.~
@751  = ~I was responsible for their lives. We were a company meant to take care of each other. It isn't so easy to let go of the guilt. Isn't it difficult for you, for past friends or loved ones you've lost?~
@752  = ~You are probably right. I'll probably not even remember it by tomorrow. I'll just stop letting it sting me so much.~
@753  = ~That is sensible. But my heart just dreads the idea of holding one for the moment.~
@754  = ~That is the pain I feel. But I guess we can take solace, that they won't be forgotten, and we will always remember them. I can find a little bit of comfort in that.~
@755  = ~Not always...sometimes things are out of your power, or...you are just a child, and the world is just very, very cruel. In those situations, I believe survival is not in your hands alone.~
@756  = ~I understand. We probably should get traveling. This talk has been enough to wake me up.~
@757  = ~Recorder. I don't remember what I was thinking when I picked that name. I could have picked Lily, or Olivia, or Peony, I've always liked flowers.~ [X3RLS]
@758  = ~Why not your real name, Rebecca? I like it well enough.~
@759  = ~I've wondered myself. It seems a fine enough stage name, but we're adventuring. You could just use your name.~
@760  = ~Recorder, are you talking to yourself?~
@761  = ~Stay focused. This isn't the time for idle thoughts.~
@762  = ~O-of course, <CHARNAME>. Sorry.~
@763  = ~I dropped Rebecca to protect myself, though it hasn't done myself much good. I also dropped it because I wanted to feel different, but that hasn't worked well either.~
@764  = ~None of your names have any flourish to them at all. I could think of a thousand far better things, though I suppose your choice works for a gnome.~
@765  = ~If I wanted your vile opinion on it, Vienxay, I would have asked for it.~
@766  = ~There's no need to be snooty, Vienxay.~
@767  = ~Vienxay has a point, Recorder. You could perhaps consider something more fanciful.~
@768  = ~Come on now, stop the needless bickering.~
@769  = ~Hrmph, I would say there is no need to overly pitiful of her either, but do as you will.~
@770  = ~That isn't me, though. I wouldn't want to pretend to be some noble.~
@771  = ~It is mere advice. It can't be bickering if there is no dispute who is right.~
@772  = ~Uh, maybe. Just thinking aloud, I guess. Now I feel a bit embarrassed. Forget I said anything.~
@773  = ~This makes me think, if you could choose a different life for yourself, would you still want to be where you are now?~
@774  = ~I've never thought of that, really.~
@775  = ~If circumstances were different, perhaps.~
@776  = ~Not really, no. I can't imagine myself doing anything else.~
@777  = ~I think I would have been a performer. If I didn't feel the need to please my mother's wishes, I would want to be going to tavern to tavern, playing for crowds and seeing all sorts of cities, from the sprawling schools of Waterdeep to Althkata's splendorous markets.~
@778  = ~You would make a fine performer, Recorder. Your music is wonderful.~
@779  = ~What about the call of adventure? That life sounds dull.~
@780  = ~Unfortunately rarely is it so easy to choose. Often we are set with the choices before us.~
@781  = ~Thank you, that is what I would want others to feel. I do love the adventuring life, though, and for now I can be satisfied with just being able to play a while when we make camp.~
@782  = ~Oh, the adventuring life is wonderful, if a bit stressful at times. I'm not going to stop anytime soon, but it's not the best long-term career if you want to have a long life!~
@783  = ~That is rather insightful. It is true that often our lives are not as full of choice as we would like. But we can still hope and dream for a future of our own desire.~
@784  = ~We've faced a multitude of dangers so far, yet you always seem...so focused and certain. Are you afraid of anything?~ [X3RLS]
@785  = ~I'm afraid of losing my companions. They are precious to me.~
@786  = ~I do not fear anything. My power sees me through.~
@787  = ~Aye, sometimes. But if I let it take over, then I offer an exploitable weakness.~
@788  = ~I would rather not discuss that with you, Recorder.~
@789  = ~Erm, as you wish, then. Forget my question.~
@790  = ~I understand dearly. I think that would be hard for anyone, even if we all know the risks.~
@791  = ~I can't imagine what that is like. Being so self-confident in your own power to see you through. It seems dangerous as it would be comforting.~
@792  = ~I think there is truth in that. I remember a strategist from a war college in Amn mentioning to some scholars in the church how others can sense fear and weakness and seize on it, prompting them to push an aggressive front.~
@793  = ~I am terrified of lightning. From the clouds, or when it bounces around in magic. It is so fast you can't even predict it, or make very little logical conclusions of where it may hit. The only knowledge I have on it is it really hurts.~
@794  = ~It makes me dislike sleeping alone on a stormy night.~
@795  = ~Just lightning? I thought you would be afraid of more then that.~
@796  = ~I'm not much a fan of storms, myself.~
@797  = ~You can always put your bedroll next to mine.~
@798  = ~What are you trying to say? I'm *not* a scaredy-gnome.~
@799  = ~Forget I said anything. Now I just feel embarrassed about myself.~
@800  = ~I'm not sure I believe that, to be honest. In all of my records of you and observations...you seem almost...~
@801  = ~W-what? *Blush*, no, that's not necessary at all! ~
@802  = ~I'm sorry for my words earlier. I shouldn't have felt so slighted when we discussed our fears.~ [X3RLS]
@803  = ~You aren't usually so easily offended.~
@804  = ~Don't worry about it, Recorder. It's nothing to be ashamed about.~
@805  = ~Forget it, Recorder. Let's just move on.~
@806  = ~A-as you wish, then.~
@807  = ~Not usually. I consider myself rather composed and hard to anger.~
@808  = ~It is something to be ashamed about. I shouldn't let something small frustrate me.~
@809  = ~When I gave myself the name Recorder years ago, I wanted to shed those silly fears. I wanted to see the world, partially to be safe from Phelgrim, but also to feel the sense of wonder.~
@810  = ~I thought I was good at being brave and...maybe even a little heroic. But after being found by Phelgrim, I don't think I've ever been more afraid.~
@811  = ~Afraid of what, exactly? Storms, death?~
@812  = ~He isn't here. He can't hurt you.~
@813  = ~If you were stronger, then you wouldn't feel this way.~
@814  = ~I am afraid of losing my freedom. Dying is easier, I think, and I learned that when I tried to escape with Raban. You can fight or you can succumb to your fate. But when you are chained, you can't do that anymore.~
@815  = ~Lightning is like that. It can paralyze you...hence my fear. Slavery is just like that.~
@816  = ~You're afraid of things circling back to the past, then.~
@817  = ~From what it seems like, you're more likely to be killed than enslaved.~
@818  = ~I won't let that happen Recorder. You don't need to worry about that.~
@819  = ~If. And I can try. But I don't know if that is the sort of strength I can come to possess.~
@820  = ~I am. History often repeats itself, not just for nations, but for people. I've heard of many tales of free slaves becoming repossessed, or worse, under the capture of another person.~
@821  = ~That is...oddly comforting, and probably true. What a horrible thing for me to take relief from.~
@822  = ~I sometimes wonder if you realize just how protective you come off others, <CHARNAME>. It's...attractive- I mean- erm... oh never mind.~
@823  = ~Fate has shown its cruel hand before. And if we aren't careful, its grasp will come to us as well.~
@824  = ~(You catch Recorder eyeing you for a long while she has her flute in her fingers, piping a few soft, low-pitched notes.)~ [X3RLS]
@825  = ~Uh, what is it Recorder? You're staring.~
@826  = ~Thinking of me while you are playing?~
@827  = ~Look ahead at the path, Recorder. This isn't the time to risk getting caught unaware.~
@828  = ~Ah, no no! *blush*. I was just dazing off.~
@829  = ~I have you that mesmerized, then?~
@830  = ~What were you thinking about?~
@831  = ~Ha, just stay focused. I wouldn't want you to get hurt from being unaware.~
@832  = ~You are a relentless teaser, <CHARNAME>. You are handsome, I'll admit.~
@833  = ~You are a relentless teaser, <CHARNAME>. You are gorgeous, I'll admit.~
@834  = ~I am thinking about my father. Your smile reminded me of him. I haven't seen him since my escape from Phelgrim. All I have of him is my flute. I was describing one I found in my travels, and he sent me this. It's precious, but I wish I could have seen him in person.~
@835  = ~Couldn't he have come and seen you, before you started traveling with me?~
@836  = ~Did you never get the chance to visit him in Lantan?~
@837  = ~Perhaps you'll get to see him someday.~
@838  = ~I don't know. Father was always...deep into his work. While I'll never know for certain, I think that was one reason my parents eventually believed their marriage was just one of Garl's pranks, he loved his duties more than my mother.~
@839  = ~What do you mean by one of Garl's pranks?~
@840  = ~I can admire someone who has a passion for their work, though not at the expense of family.~
@841  = ~Do you have any other family?~
@842  = ~No, I never did. I was working on chronicling everything going on in Baldur's Gate. I'm like him in a way, always prioritizing my work. I think that was one of the reasons my parents believed their marriage was just one of Garl's pranks, he loved his duties more than my mother.~
@843  = ~Oh! Sorry...I was just dazing off. I'm putting away my flute now.~
@844  = ~It's a phrase  we use in Lantan. There's a bit of humor based in how we engage in these sort of things. If you can't have a good laugh, even at your own expense, it's hard to be a good spouse to someone.~
@845  = ~I do wish my father did make more time for other things. Even I took a break now and then for bonding with mother and the other scholars, but if he's happy, I'm happy.~
@846  = ~You don't *sound* happy. You sound more resigned.~
@847  = ~You don't have to accept that. You can demand more of him.~
@848  = ~It sounds as if you aren't as important to him as you think.~
@849  = ~I guess. At least your father isn't alive to disappoint you.~
@850  = ~Erm, what am I even saying? *Sigh*. I'm just going to be quiet before I say something else that is rude.~
@851  = ~No, actually. I wish I had siblings, or even much extended family to talk about, but it was really just us. It could make it lonely sometimes growing up, even if I did enjoy reading all of the books my father was binding and repairing.~
@852  = ~Do...do you think me annoying? I try not to ramble, but you didn't seem interested in conversation last time I tried to speak.~ [X3RLS]
@853  = ~Do not stress yourself over it. It just wasn't the time.~
@854  = ~Why do you think that of yourself?~
@855  = ~You're right, Recorder. I do find you annoying.~
@856  = ~I'm just not in the mood to chat. Nor am I in the mood now.~
@857  = ~I keep feeling the need to apologize. I shouldn't have said what I did about your father. I must seem so annoying to you.~
@858  = ~It was an honest mistake. Do not stress yourself over it.~
@859  = ~Forget it and move on Recorder. Bringing it up now isn't the right time.~
@860  = ~Are you that insecure you must constantly seek their reassurance for everything? It's quite pathetic.~
@861  = ~Quite annoying. Must you always seek their validation? I find it quite pathetic.~
@862  = ~Why do you feel the need to butt in, Vienxay? All you ever do with your tongue is spew insults left and right.~
@863  = ~Tsk tsk. Jealousy looks so hideous on you. There's no need to string her along, <CHARNAME>. Tell her.~
@864  = ~I'm not stringing her along, Vienxay. I care about Recorder.~
@865  = ~Vienxay has a point. Have a spine, Recorder. Stop constantly seeking my reassurance.~
@866  = ~Leave her alone, Vienxay. She's certainly not as frustrating as you are.~
@867  = ~Maybe it is just the times, or how long I have been on the road, but I always try to be careful with how I speak. Lately I feel...less than my usual self, I guess.~
@868  = ~I could repay your patience by sharing an encounter I had with Gorion if you like? It was actually how I first learned of you.~
@869  = ~I would like to hear it.~
@870  = ~You knew Gorion?~
@871  = ~I remember you telling me a little about your time with him.~
@872  = ~Maybe another time, Recorder.~
@873  = ~Hrmph. Fools will be fools, then.~
@874  = ~Oh. I-I understand, then. Another time.~
@875  = ~I'll...I'll just shut up then. You won't have to worry about me being annoying anymore.~
@876  = ~We were in the library, going over some abjuration wards. He was quite fond of shields against magical energies and was intent on learning a way to project it onto another.~
@877  = ~He spoke so gushingly of you, and Imoen too. I could feel in him the love, but also of some protective instinct. You were his everything. The way he talked reminded me so much of how I felt when I had Raban just so...so...~
@878  = ~So...?~
@879  = ~Not again. You need to get past this.~
@880  = ~I will be. I just need some more time it seems. But it is nice to try to push past the pain a little more each time with you.~
@881  = ~I know, and I will. I just need more time. But it is nice to try to push past the pain a little more each time with you.~
@882  = ~I...I don't think I can continue. I just need some more time it seems. But it is nice to try to push past the pain a little more each time with you.~
@883  = ~I remember something I learned from one of the monks in Candlekeep. About the meaning of the sharing of knowledge and experiences with one another, and how they help us connect with people.~ [X3RLS]
@884  = ~And what was this about?~
@885  = ~Go on.~
@886  = ~This isn't the time for one of your stories.~
@887  = ~The knowledge we gain from tomes and manuals helps us achieve greater understanding. But the experiences we gain from the lessons of life help us achieve greater empathy and love.~
@888  = ~I'll never forgive myself about Raban. I know that now. But I am not alone. With the people we've come across in our own journeys, and all around the world, everyone has suffered. Everyone has felt pain. But they all keep on living. And that's the beauty in living, even through hardship.~
@889  = ~And as a bard, I have the power to have their experiences be added to the weave of history. I have the ability to help people remember those who were not fortunate, and keep their lessons preserved, even my own failures.~
@890  = ~It sounds like you've come to terms with your pain. I'm glad.~
@891  = ~It took you long enough.~
@892  = ~That is a beautiful belief. I find myself liking your thoughts.~
@893  = ~I'm sorry for...languishing on things so much. But now I think I have the strength to really look forward.~
@894  = ~I have you to thank really. Your patience and listening has made it a lot easier to come to this place.~
@895  = ~I guess when I finish with the record of  your journey, you'll be more than just a hero for others, but for me, too.~
@896  = ~Heh. You look up too fondly at me, Recorder.~
@897  = ~What can I say? I can't let a beautiful gnome suffer.~
@898  = ~Only to those who are useful to me.~
@899  = ~It is easy to be charmed by you, though. Strong, heroic, and just this aura about you that makes things seem okay, even as we trek into dangerous places.~
@900  = ~Just don't let all of that get into your head now that I said it or tease me about it later. But...I am quite glad that I met you.~
@901  = ~Oh. You're making me blush. You really are like the heroes they write about in legend.~
@902  = ~I...it is just about use then? Maybe I had things wrong in my head. I thought you were different. I guess I was overthinking everything.~
@903  = ~If that is how you feel, I'll save it for another time, perhaps.~
@904  = ~I was never really well trained in combat, but what do you think about my skills in weapons?~ [X3RLS]
@905  = ~You're a sharp eye at ranged. It's proven its value more than once.~
@906  = ~To be honest your skills with weapons is rather lacking, even for a bard.~
@907  = ~I've never valued your combat skills, but instead your music and magic.~
@908  = ~Why do you ask?~
@909  = ~That was...well never mind that. I think I was asking your thoughts on my skills with weapons.~
@910  = ~All this time, I've really only tried to improve my mind and knowledge, that I feel like I've neglected other skills.~
@911  = ~Even in the art of weapons, there are different styles, and schools of thought, and strategies. I want to learn those things, <CHARNAME>. I want to be the best version of me I can.~
@912  = ~Rounding yourself out? I think that is a fine pursuit.~
@913  = ~Try as you might, I don't think you're ever going to be a good warrior.~
@914  = ~I like the version of you that you are now, Recorder. You don't have to be perfect.~
@915  = ~We best keep moving.~
@916  = ~Oh...I'll stop rambling on, then.~
@917  = ~It will be difficult. I'm...not very physically strong, or quick. But I have the will to try as hard it takes, to be the best me.~
@918  = ~I know you are probably right. But that doesn't mean I should settle, or try. If I rely only on my magic, there could come a day where that is not a tool I can use, and I want to always be able to help you.~
@919  = ~Evil comes in many forms. And I want to be prepared for all of them, so they can be stopped, your foes, or any others.~
@920  = ~Oh come on now, Recorder. That's the lamest come on I've ever heard.~
@921  = ~What are you talking about? Why are you being so crass?~
@922  = ~Don't try to deny it. You get all bothered thinking about it, eh? Too bad it's one-sided. I can think of someone else <CHARNAME> is more interested in.~
@923  = ~Do you mind Kale? She was asking me a question.~
@924  = ~Kale's right. There is uh, someone else.~
@925  = ~I think you assume too much of yourself, Kale.~
@926  = ~Recorder and I are just friends, Kale. I never assumed this was anything else.~
@927  = ~Damn. I guess I got overconfident for once. Well, I know when to butt out, I'll just watch our back. Cheers!~
@928  = ~Because she likes you. But I can think of someone strong, and handsome to boot that you prefer. Let her down gently, eh?~
@929  = ~R-right. We're just friends. I understand~
@930  = ~Ha, I was right! Hear that tone of disappointment. You sure know how to let them down.~
@931  = ~Just leave me alone, Kale. You've had your fun.~
@932  = ~My feet are so sore. I am glad we are stopping. Do you mind...sitting with me for a while?~ [X3RLS]
@933  = ~Certainly. Let me make myself comfortable.~
@934  = ~What did you want to talk about?~
@935  = ~Not right now. I just want to get some rest.~
@936  = ~Sleep well then, <CHARNAME>.~
@937  = ~Is there something going on between you two? Oops. That was rather blunt of me.~
@938  = ~Erm...I'm not sure how to answer that.~
@939  = ~You've gotten rather close is all. I admit it's...well, I just thought...~
@940  = ~There's no need to over-react, Emily. We're just friends.~
@941  = ~I apologize for misleading you, Emily.~
@942  = ~I'm fond of Recorder, Emily, though don't pressure me to label anything.~
@943  = ~No need to be jealous, Emily. You are the special one to me.~
@944  = ~I...didn't know you felt that way Emily. I'm glad we got this over with now before things got awkward.~
@945  = ~Right. I'm er, sorry for interrupting. I'll leave you alone.~
@946  = ~I'm actually more tired than I thought. I think I'll get some rest.~
@947  = ~Well, I'm happy for my friend then. I'll not be in the way of whatever this is. I'm going to shoot a few arrows before I get some rest.~
@948  = ~*sigh*. I hope she isn't upset with me.~
@949  = ~She seems understanding, actually. But what did you want to talk about?~
@950  = ~She'll live. I don't think it would have worked out anyway, considering her station.~
@951  = ~If she is as good as a friend as it seems, she'll come around.~
@952  = ~I hope so. I owe her so much.~
@953  = ~I can understand your decision. But let us talk about something else.~
@954  = ~I remember when I first started adventuring. I was terrified of everything. Sir Marc Harmon had always kept me in check and reminded me of how important it was to keep a cool head.~
@955  = ~You've not told me much of your first adventures.~
@956  = ~You are quite different now. Stronger and braver.~
@957  = ~You still are terrified of many things.~
@958  = ~I would be glad to share it to you. I don't count...anything before my freedom as an adventure, so this is after I left Amn to go north.~
@959  = ~You don't have to be mean, <CHARNAME>. But maybe you are just giving your view. I should respect it.~
@960  = ~I had to learn that. I can remember the first time I saw just how dangerous traveling can be.~
@961  = ~I remember I was traveling from Baldur's Gate to Candlekeep. I traveled with a caravan to Baldur's Gate from Amn but that was rather uneventful.~
@962  = ~Iron had started to be contaminated and the bandits beginning to form around the land. I met my first hobgoblin on that journey. They were using a cliff for high ground and fired arrows down at us when we got too close unawares.~
@963  = ~I fired my crossbow back at them as Marc pushed forward with his shield out. One of them pierced my arm with an arrow and I lost the grip on my weapon and it dropped to the ground. I thought that was it for a moment, but Marc covered me with his shield before charging up the hill.~
@964  = ~It was my first sight of courage. Before then I only saw his poor attempts of womanizing in taverns...it made me realize just how deep people can be.~
@965  = ~What happened after that?~
@966  = ~He sounds like he was a good man.~
@967  = ~Heh. Had he traveled with me, he'd have seen some true heroics.~
@968  = ~He helped nurse my arm and we made our way to Candlekeep. I thanked him by being a little less harsh on his flirting distractions. I wish he was still here.~
@969  = ~A very good man. Sometimes silly...but I think that just made him even more wonderful. I wish he was still here.~
@970  = ~It isn't a competition. But...I think he would have definitely loved traveling with you. I wish he was still here.~
@971  = ~I should get some rest, but thanks for listening. Talking with you is always so soothing. (She moves to squeeze your hand.)~
@972  = ~(Squeeze back.)~
@973  = ~Goodnight, Recorder.~
@974  = ~(Move your hands away from her reach.)~
@975  = ~I'm sorry Recorder, but I don't like you that way.~
@976  = ~(She smiles at you, blushing slightly, before turning to move to her bedroll.)~
@977  = ~Oh erm, sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. Sleep well.~
@978  = ~(You notice Gustav, Recorder's ferret, escaping his bag and moving around your feet.)~ [X3RLS]
@979  = ~(Give him a treat.)~
@980  = ~(Pick him up and pet him.)~
@981  = ~(Bat him away.)~
@982  = ~(Ignore him.)~
@983  = ~(After a small whining noise, the ferret eventually darts about and back into his owner bag, Recorder oblivious all the while.)~
@984  = ~(The creature purrs as you feed it, making several content noises.~
@985  = ~Gustav? How did you get over to <CHARNAME>? Heehee, convincing others to give you food, I see.~
@986  = ~He's quite the lovable ferret.~
@987  = ~I don't know how you can stand his behavior all the time. He'd drive me crazy.~
@988  = ~Just try not to lose him. It's not necessarily safe.~
@989  = ~(The creature purrs at the attention, rubbing its head against you.~
@990  = ~Gustav? Heehee, it seems he really likes you.~
@991  = ~(The ferret makes a hissing noise at you, followed by a couple of loud cries.)~
@992  = ~Gustav? What are you doing outside of my pack? I'm sorry if he annoyed you.~
@993  = ~Oh don't worry, he just startled me.~
@994  = ~Right. I'll be more careful, though Gustav is a very brave ferret. Sometimes I think he looks out for me more than I do to him.~
@995  = ~(Laughs) Oh, you assume he doesn't? He's the worst when he gets dirty and there's nowhere to bathe him nearby, and he gets the dirt all over me when I sleep. But I love him.~
@996  = ~I like to believe that he reminds me about the little joys in life. In our journeys we've seen so much sadness and death and sometimes I think that grimness gets to us.~
@997  = ~But if we can remember the little joys...the little fur balls and why we are doing what we are doing, I think it gives us such important levity.~
@998  = ~That is quite true, Recorder. I wouldn't mind having Gustav come to me more if that's his secret magic.~
@999  = ~It is hard to remember that out here. What we do is a heavy task.~
@1000 = ~That's a rather silly belief. A little naive, don't you think?~
@1001 = ~Oh, you'll have to try harder then that to win Gustav away from me. (Winks) But, I'll let you borrow my baby from time to time.~
@1002 = ~It is. But if all we focus on is the road ahead, then we can't find the needed levity to make the load a little lighter. That is the power in small things, a power that shouldn't be underestimated, if one can remember it.~
@1003 = ~I don't. Even the poorest person can find a moment of joy in just watching a dog dart by and greet in its excited way, or a little child playing from out their window. Any joy and motivation is better than pure grimness and more self-weight. This I learned recently...and I think it would do us all well to remember it.~
@1004 = ~Can I play something for you, before you rest? I've been practicing it for a while when on watch, but I want to play this. It's a song, for you.~ [X3RLS]
@1005 = ~Certainly.~
@1006 = ~I wouldn't mind listening.~
@1007 = ~I'd rather not hear more of your music.~
@1008 = ~Another time. I am very weary.~
@1009 = ~If...if you are sure. I'll leave you alone, then.~
@1010 = ~I will ask you another night, then. Rest well.~
@1011 = ~(You recognize the tune's motif from her playing several days back. She keeps your gaze as she plays, swaying a bit in a little dance. When she's done, she gives a timid bow.)~ [X3RLSA]
@1012 = ~That was beautiful.~
@1013 = ~That was what you were playing when you were looking at me several days ago.~
@1014 = ~I'm afraid that's not your best performance, to be honest.~
@1015 = ~Oh I am glad you liked it. I was so worried...I've never serenaded someone before, but I thought it could help lighten your mood.~
@1016 = ~Recorder, I've delayed bringing this up, but I wanted to bring up how things ended in Dragonspear between us.~
@1017 = ~This was for me?~
@1018 = ~I feel quite honored. No one's ever serenaded me before.~
@1019 = ~Recorder, I need to ask you something.~
@1020 = ~Y-yes. I can't lie. I was playing this song for you.~
@1021 = ~Oh, I was worried it would be a disaster. I should have gone with a different theme, I should have thought of a better serenade for you.~
@1022 = ~No, don't stress, Recorder. I'm honestly quite honored.~
@1023 = ~Yes, you should have, though don't bother trying again. You've ruined my night.~
@1024 = ~It was. You were the muse for this piece, and also its recipient.~
@1025 = ~I am quite surprised. You are attractive, <CHARNAME>. Certainly the type of person a bard would be compelled to play a piece for.~
@1026 = ~Those words are...cruel, and not how I wanted it to go. I'll just leave  you alone, then.~
@1027 = ~Y-yes?~
@1028 = ~I'm beginning to become very fond of you. I want to know if you return my feelings...if this is something we can proceed with.~
@1029 = ~Back in Dragonspear, you said there couldn't be a future between us. Is that still true?~
@1030 = ~Never mind. I've lost my courage. This is a bad idea.~
@1031 = ~I need to say this while I have my courage...but I really like you, <CHARNAME>. I've grown enamored, and with all the time we've spent together, I don't know if I want to keep stepping so lightly around this.~
@1032 = ~Am I crazy? Is there some chance that...you might feel the same?~
@1033 = ~(Kiss her.)~
@1034 = ~I do.~
@1035 = ~You are crazy, I don't feel that way at all.~
@1036 = ~(She doesn't respond, but moves her hand towards your face.)~
@1037 = ~(She pulls you to herself, and presses her lips to yours. Her breathe feels slightly warm, before she pulls away abruptly.)~
@1038 = ~(Pull her back in for another kiss.)~
@1039 = ~That was...nice.~
@1040 = ~You call that a kiss? That was as bad as smooching a gibberling.~
@1041 = ~(She tip-toes on her feet, and pulls you down to her, lips meeting yours. Her breathe feels slightly warm when you connect for the briefest moment, before she pulls away abruptly.)~
@1042 = ~What? How could y- I feel so embarrassed. I'm just going to get some sleep. Forget this happened, it won't happen again.~
@1043 = ~(She reciprocates your advance, her hands wrapping around your neck. A moment too soon you feel her withdraw, ever smiling.)~
@1044 = ~Yes...it was.~
@1045 = ~I have a ferret to feed before he grows rebellious but...I hope we can do this again soon. Rest well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1046 = ~Thank you for being honest with me before I did something stupid. I-I...wish you a good rest, <CHARNAME>.~
@1047 = ~She looks only slightly startled, before she reciprocates. You feel her warm breath briefly from her soft lips, before she pulls away).~
@1048 = ~I wish we did this a lot sooner.~
@1049 = ~Yes...so do I.~
@1050 = ~I need to ask you something, <CHARNAME>. Do you have affections for someone else in our party?~ [X3RLS]
@1051 = ~We had a sweet moment. But I don't want to share, and I don't want to hurt someone else. If you have strong feelings for another, I understand, and won't get in the way.~
@1052 = ~If you want me to devote to yourself alone, then I choose to do this. Let us see how far this goes.~
@1053 = ~Then I won't waste your time. I have strong feelings for Aerie.~
@1054 = ~Then I'm going to admit something...odd, but I care for Jaheria as more than just my guardian.~
@1055 = ~I will tell you the truth then. I care very much for Anomen.~
@1056 = ~Viconia has ensnared my heart.~
@1057 = ~I have grown close with Rasaad. I think he is good for me.~
@1058 = ~It's a little wild, but I'm beginning to see myself with Neera.~
@1059 = ~I'm beginning to fall for Sirene. I hope you understand.~
@1060 = ~I find Petsy charming. I think she is right for me.~
@1061 = ~It was all strange at first, but I think I am in love with Yvette.~
@1062 = ~I find myself deeply attracted to Dorn.~
@1063 = ~I am fond of Hexxat, Recorder.~
@1064 = ~There is no one else but you, Recorder.~
@1065 = ~I'm not interested in starting a relationship with anyone, nor talking about it.~
@1066 = ~My feelings for you Recorder don't run as deep as you think. I'd rather be friends.~
@1067 = ~I...see. Just take care of her. I see a little of myself in her. I think you'll do well together if you watch over her well.~
@1068 = ~I understand. I think you will do well together, even if I wonder about Anomen sometimes.~
@1069 = ~Erm...well, it can't be as odd as your own biographer starting to do the same with you. But I'm glad you told me. I hope it works for you and her.~
@1070 = ~I...don't agree with your decision. But maybe you can bring out the best of Viconia. Maybe you will do well and show her how wonderful love can be.~
@1071 = ~Rasaad is a good man, and a good choice. I can't be mad...instead I will hope the best for you both.~
@1072 = ~Erm, well...as long as you know what you are getting into. At the very least, no day will be normal if it goes well for you.~
@1073 = ~I don't know what you see in that blackguard. But if that's what you want...then there is nothing further I have to say.~
@1074 = ~I...was not expecting that you would feel that way about Hexxat. But if that is what your heart wants, I have nothing more to say.~
@1075 = ~I must admit...maybe it was fate for you two, how she came out of the portrait. I won't stand in the way of that. I hope it works out.~
@1076 = ~Petsy is lovely. Just watch over her well, and I think your bond will last a long time.~
@1077 = ~I do understand. Thank you for telling me. I hope things go well between you two.~
@1078 = ~That makes me happy. I want to see where this goes between us. I'm glad you do too.~
@1079 = ~Well...thank you for telling me this now. Before I-...well that doesn't matter anymore.~
@1080 = ~There is something I find difficult when I am taking the time to write down our travels. And it's how to describe you, physically that is.~ [X3RLS]
@1081 = ~Is it so hard? I could give you a closer preview if you need to find the words.~
@1082 = ~I could give you a few suggestions, if you like.~
@1083 = ~I do not think that is important. I would rather let my deeds speak for me.~
@1084 = ~*Blush*. Must you say things like that? Not that I would mind...~
@1085 = ~Like what?~
@1086 = ~Clever and intelligent.~
@1087 = ~Gorgeous and striking.~
@1088 = ~Handsome and dashing.~
@1089 = ~Just an average person.~
@1090 = ~Average? I think we can agree you are far from that.~
@1091 = ~Clever and intelligent, hmm? I do not think those are "physical" traits, <CHARNAME>, heehee.~
@1092 = ~I know you are gorgeous. There is no question about that.~
@1093 = ~I know you are handsome. There is no question about that.~
@1094 = ~It is just that everyone will wonder just who you were. Tall, short, straight hair, curly hair, blue eyes, green eyes. And history has shown to get those details wrong.~
@1095 = ~Heehee, I suppose there is nothing wrong with someone using their imagination to feel the gaps.~
@1096 = ~Then do just that. Let them imagine it.~
@1097 = ~Well we can't have that, can we? Give me the best details. And don't mention any skin flaws.~
@1098 = ~I don't know if I'm comfortable being seen that way.~
@1099 = ~I like that idea. Where words can't describe it, maybe imagination is the real answer.~
@1100 = ~(She takes your hand and squeezes it.) Maybe in their imagination, they'll find the words that I can't to describe just how great you are.~
@1101 = ~Skin flaws? Erm, I will confess, those make you even more attractive. And really bring you to life, I think that is what I will do.~
@1102 = ~I am kidding <CHARNAME>, do not worry. Your request is heard...but I was honest when I meant they do make you more attractive.~
@1103 = ~As a hero? I can understand your point I think, and respect it. Maybe I will leave it be and not stress over that too much.~
@1104 = ~But you are a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. People look up to you. I look up to you. And that isn't a bad thing at all.~
@1105 = ~I am not sure if you are being modest, or humbly bragging. (She laughs).~
@1106 = ~Your life has been constant adventure since you left home, hasn't it? Do you see...something peaceful down the road? Settling down, with a partner, maybe?~ [X3RLS]
@1107 = ~Like with you?~
@1108 = ~I've been on the road so long, I can't imagine anything else.~
@1109 = ~It's hard to think about that right now, given everything that is going on.~
@1110 = ~Yes... I think I would still even be happy with adventuring, or anywhere with you...if I am in any future of yours.~
@1111 = ~If you let me, aye.~
@1112 = ~I don't think we're on the same page of things, Recorder. You're not in my plans.~
@1113 = ~I don't know, Recorder. Anything could happen to end this abruptly.~
@1114 = ~I understand but...I am guess I am wondering if I am in any future of yours.~
@1115 = ~(She beams, tip-toeing to close the distance. A kiss. A sweet stolen moment.)~
@1116 = ~Ugh, disgusting. I'm going to be sick.~
@1117 = ~Damn. I don't have a good angle.~
@1118 = ~Bah, there are battles to be fought here.~
@1119 = ~Aww, how sweet.~
@1120 = ~(She moves closer, lips puckering. A kiss. A sweet stolen moment.)~
@1121 = ~I'm truly glad you said that, <CHARNAME>. Maybe we can find some more time later for each other.~
@1122 = ~I...see. I am glad you told me this now, at least, before it would be more painful to hear. Let's...just keep moving.~
@1123 = ~Anything could happen. And if you don't want to make a decision now, I understand. I'll take the joy I can get.~
@1124 = ~Just do not be afraid to embrace the life you know you have now, if you are afraid of the life you may not get a chance to have tomorrow.~
@1125 = ~<CHARNAME>, I know you must be eager to get some rest, but...I was wondering if I could say something to you.~ [X3RLS]
@1126 = ~I am listening, Recorder.~
@1127 = ~Is something wrong?~
@1128 = ~I am quite exhausted, Recorder. Another time.~
@1129 = ~Nothing is wrong, actually. As strange as it is, this is the happiest I've been in a while, but that's just the thing.~
@1130 = ~I don't know what will happen next. When people die...resurrection doesn't always work. Sometimes when something bad happens, it's irreversible.~
@1131 = ~I lost my son. And in this journey, I know I might lose you too.~
@1132 = ~I have never spent a night with someone who...who I actually love. And if I wait, I may never get the chance to.~
@1133 = ~I know we have not known each other for very long...but that is how I feel. I...well...what do you think?~
@1134 = ~I love you too, Recorder. I would like to share this night with you.~
@1135 = ~This is a bit sudden. I am not sure what to think.~
@1136 = ~I would rather wait, Recorder, until it is right.~
@1137 = ~I've known you since we first met back around Baldur's Gate. And I think I have felt this way for a long time. I just......well...what do you think?~
@1138 = ~You seem so confident we will make it to that time. I will try to share your enthusiasm and be patient. It gives us something to look forward to.~
@1139 = ~I won't take more of your time. Get some rest, my love.~
@1140 = ~Maybe you don't need to think. We spend so much time thinking and plotting and planning and wondering, we can't see what is right there.~
@1141 = ~Stay with me. Let us not think for a moment and just let it go for a while.~
@1142 = ~Very well, Recorder. Let us share this night together.~
@1143 = ~If that is what you want.~
@1144 = ~I think I want to wait, Recorder, until it is right.~
@1145 = ~I'd rather be alone right now, Recorder.~
@1146 = ~Let us find somewhere away from the others then...and see where the night takes us.~
@1147 = ~Another time, then. Rest well.~
@1148 = ~(You wake up with Recorder leaning against your arm. As you stir, she lifts herself up to look at you.)~
@1149 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL>, beautiful.~
@1150 = ~Last night was...something.~
@1151 = ~It's time to get up, Recorder. We have much to accomplish.~
@1152 = ~So soon? I was so comfortable. Mmm. We will have to find more time later, just you and I, when this is all over.~
@1153 = ~Good <DAYNIGHTALL>, my love.~
@1154 = ~Wasn't it? It was...wonderful. How it should feel between two people.~
@1155 = ~I felt loved, truly loved. And safe. Protected. Like I know everything will stay okay.~
@1156 = ~I hate to leave this space with you, but we should get ready to set out again.~
@1157 = ~Aye, let's. The road awaits us.~
@1158 = ~Why so soon? The others haven't stirred yet, and I can think of a few things we can do to pass the time...~
@1159 = ~I hate to go, too. This was nice.~
@1160 = ~What are yo- ooh. You are no innocent <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>.~
@1161 = ~It was. But when we've accomplished everything we've set out to do, we can look forward to more days like this, just the two of us.~
@1162 = ~Erm, Veldrin? Do you have a moment?~ [X3RLS]
@1163 = ~What is it, my mistress?~
@1164 = ~Be more firm, Recorder.~
@1165 = ~How about we find a room? We'll have a bit of privacy, then.~
@1166 = ~Not here. This is a bad time to speak.~
@1167 = ~As you wish, then.~
@1168 = ~Just come here.~
@1169 = ~There are...slaves. Slaves everywhere. So much evil and darkness and drow and...horrible monsters. This is somehow *worse* than Brynnlaw.~
@1170 = ~You need to keep it together, Recorder. We can't afford to reveal ourselves.~
@1171 = ~Take a breath. I am here. But you must be strong. You must appear as drow.~
@1172 = ~I don't have time to deal with this, Recorder.~
@1173 = ~I am a bard but this...this is probably the most difficult thing you have asked of me. How can I do this?~
@1174 = ~Think of our love. Think of the warmth when we are able to be together when we finally get out of here.~
@1175 = ~We've made it through Brynnlaw, through Spellhold, and got into the city. Think of your own strength. Know you are stronger than you believe yourself to be.~
@1176 = ~You will do this because I am telling you to. And you do not want to fail me.~
@1177 = ~That does warm me a little. Still, let us be gone from this place as soon as we have done what we need to.~
@1178 = ~You really know how to flatter and cheer someone up, <CHARNAME>. I can do this. But, let's be gone from this place as soon as we have done what we need to.~
@1179 = ~That...yes. As you say. Let's just be gone from here as soon as we can.~
@1180 = ~J-just...come over here.~
@1181 = ~That would be too distracting...and your form is distracting enough as is.~
@1182 = ~It's kind of funny thinking back of my experience being in a ferret's body. I feel so much closer to Gustav.~ [X3RLS]
@1183 = ~I think I would rather you not get that close to Gustav ever again.~
@1184 = ~I am just glad to have you back.~
@1185 = ~We're so close. We can talk more once this is over.~
@1186 = ~We are. Can we actually...make camp? Not just to strategize and get our supplies in order but...~
@1187 = ~I was nearly torn from you once. And I want to spend a moment close to you. The risk of it happening again isn't going to be any less.~
@1188 = ~And I am glad you helped me get back to my body. I truly thought if I didn't, I might be forced to fight against you, and I couldn't bear the thought. I would rather be joined with Gustav for life. Without you, I would have been, too.~
@1189 = ~Heehee, I don't think Gustav was altogether a fan of the experience. He'd prefer physical over spiritual cuddling, I think.~
@1190 = ~This might be the last chance we get to truly rest and relax together, before things become uncertain and...perhaps even more difficult.~
@1191 = ~Can we...set up camp? Not just to strategize and get our supplies in order...but just to spend the only bit of time we know we will get to have.~
@1192 = ~As my love wishes, as my love gets.~
@1193 = ~I would like that, Recorder. It seems a fine idea.~
@1194 = ~I would rather wait. To have something to push me and look forward to.~
@1195 = ~Delaying won't us do any good. I want to finish this now.~
@1196 = ~(She eagerly waves you over to help set up your tent as your party sets up camp. As soon as you finish she pulls you inside, being sure to close the flap.)~
@1197 = ~You are patient, <CHARNAME>. If waiting is what you wish, then I look forward to our time when Irenicus is stopped.~
@1198 = ~Then...then let us not delay. I want to see him finished, too.~
@1199 = ~I will pray to Oghma and the Lords of the Golden Hills that they see us all through this in one piece.~
@1200 = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@1201 = ~Such as this sweet little gnome. How terrible it will be to suffer such a loss.~
@1202 = ~I...I am a Lorekeeper. I know what you mean and intend, and I can't let you do that.~
@1203 = ~If you are so knowledgeable, girl, you know very well you cannot resist the charms and lull of the darkness.~
@1204 = ~No! I *won't* be a slave to anyone, ever again!~
@1205 = ~Recorder, what are you doing?~
@1206 = ~Recorder, wait!~
@1207 = ~Follow my orders, Recorder!~
@1208 = ~Taking my freedom.~
@1209 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, but this is the only choice.~
@1210 = ~Impressive. Taking her own life with some spell before I could claim her. Her cold body will do regardless. Follow me further and you will lose more than you can imagine... beginning now!~
@1211 = ~We can do this. We won't lose.~
@1212 = ~You have taken too much already! Return Imoen's soul, and Recorder!~
@1213 = ~And you have delivered on that promise. Return Recorder's body and perhaps I will be merciful.~
@1214 = ~I would have hunted you for your theft of Recorder alone. I will not lose her!~
@1215 = ~You place too much confidence in sentiment. The theft of Recorder's body will not save you.~
@1216 = ~An interesting ploy, though I am sure her fate will still serve as an example, whether you wish her back or not.~
@1217 = ~Your little gnome love is dead, <CHARNAME>. Even with my attempts to give her undeath she remains cold. When I am done with you, I will figure out her spell and make her one of my own all the same.~
@1218 = ~I would pity you and let you join her, but it would be far more delightful to keep you forever apart.~
@1219 = ~(Recorder's body is cold and lifeless in your arms. Despite Bodhi's taunts, she did not lie to you - Recorder remains dead.)~ [C0BLANK]
@1220 = ~This...this is not right. It shouldn't end like this, not for Recorder. Maybe her mother or another priest in the temple of Oghma can think of someway to reverse this fate.~
@1221 = ~I'm so sorry, little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. I can't believe she's gone... but maybe there's still a way we can bring her back.~
@1222 = ~M-my spells...they won't work when she's like this. But...m-maybe the priests of Oghma can help us.~
@1223 = ~So foolish the girl, she did not need to take her life. Forgive my words, this must be difficult on you, <CHARNAME>. And yet, there could still be hope. Perhaps the church of Oghma may be of assistance.~
@1224 = ~Recorder does not deserve such an unjust end, <CHARNAME>. I do not wish to give you false hope, but I would suggest that perhaps the priests of Oghma could give us assistance.~
@1225 = ~Hrngh. Nay a warrior's death ,nor a fitting death. But Haela cannot give me the power to undo what she had done to let her walk again. I say we speak to the temple of Oghma, and see what can be done.~
@1226 = ~This... was not what she deserved. I would draw upon Helm's power to bring her back, but I fear no magic could reverse such a sacrificial death. I am truly sorry, <CHARNAME>. We should bring her body to her fellow clergymen.~
@1227 = ~So, the elg'caress's foolishness became the death of her, as I expected. Do not look at me, <CHARNAME>, I have no power to restore her in that condition. She has fellows in this wretched city, does she not? Beg them for aid if you must.~
@1228 = ~Bloody hell... She's really dead. I...don't even know what to say. I guess...we should tell that temple of hers, Oghma, what transpired.~
@1229 = ~The goldfinch is silent in her final cadence and yet I can still hear the echos of her last song in my head. Death never returns what it takes, but perhaps the temple of the seekers of knowledge may know a way to steal life back.~
@1230 = ~(Out from one of Recorder's inner pocket squirms free Gustav. The animal moves its way to you and brushes against your foot, giving a low cry.)~
@1231 = ~I am sorry, Gustav. But I will do my utmost to help her.~
@1232 = ~Your wails can do nothing for her, ferret. Jump in my pack and lets go.~
@1233 = ~Your master is gone, Gustav. She cannot hear you.~
@1234 = ~(The animal seems to acknowledge you with a brief nod, before leaping towards you and finding a home in your pack.)~
@1235 = ~I...thought my words in Dragonspear were the end of it. Maybe I was too harsh with my words then.~
@1236 = ~I like you, <CHARNAME>. I do. But last time we got close things happened and...I don't know if I am ready.~
@1237 = ~I hope you understand. It's not...a never. But it's not a now. Let's see what happens?~
@1238 = ~I understand, Recorder. Let's see what happens.~
@1239 = ~As you wish.~
@1240 = ~No, actually. I have no interest in waiting around for you.~
@1241 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I do like you. Do know that, please, despite all of this, I do like you a lot.~
@1242 = ~I am sorry for making you angry. Let's just...not talk about this again.~
@1243 = ~B-but...it's not just us! I m-mean...~
@1244 = ~Awwww!~
@1245 = ~Pah. Stop your stuttering and get it done so we can get back to fighting something.~
@1246 = ~I can kiss Recorder first if she needs to get comfortable. What? I'm kidding!~
@1247 = ~Great. Now I have to watch you slobber over each other.~
@1248 = ~Okay. But just a quick one.~
@1249 = ~Mmm. That was nice. I love you so much.~
@1250 = ~This...is hard for me to say, <CHARNAME>. I don't know if you see things the same way as of late, but I think we should talk about it.~
@1251 = ~When we first started our relationship, things were sweet and I was the happiest I have known. But lately you have been so different. You aren't the same person I fell in love with.~
@1252 = ~You even...scare me a little, sometimes. And so, as much as it hurts to say, I want to end things between us.~
@1253 = ~But I don't want to end things, Recorder.~
@1254 = ~I think you are right. Things haven't been the same as of late.~
@1255 = ~So you are just giving up, then?~
@1256 = ~I know it hurts. But...I don't want to wait for the impossible. Keep hoping for the impossible. Many duets come to an end. Our song is just at its conclusion.~
@1257 = ~Oh, that makes this...less difficult then. I'm glad we are on the same page.~
@1258 = ~I'm sorry. I just...let go. I have waited before and only known pain. I can't do that again.~
@1259 = ~If it's easier...I can just leave the party. I leave the choice to you.~
@1260 = ~I think that is best. Goodbye, Recorder.~
@1261 = ~Do so. But your equipment stays with me.~
@1262 = ~No. Please. Stay. I would still have you with me, even if we aren't lovers.~
@1263 = ~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. I will remember you.~
@1264 = ~...As you wish. Goodbye.~
@1265 = ~Then I will. It will be nice to see your story through, even if things are different.~
@1266 = ~Unbelievable. I...usually stay quiet, and I have trusted your leadership and recorded your story this far, but I can't go on without speaking.~ [X3RAnn]
@1267 = ~Your treatment to others has been terrible. You sing like your song is the only one that matters, but we live in a world where there are many singers, and harmonies to form together. Not just your own.~
@1268 = ~Speak clearly or stay silent, Recorder.~
@1269 = ~And what would you have me do differently?~
@1270 = ~I am sorry. It has been difficult to make those kind of decisions.~
@1271 = ~Then I hope this is clear: I am saying leaving, unless you are willing to try to improve, to change.~
@1272 = ~I want you to try to be more considerate. What you have done I despise with every part of my being.~
@1273 = ~If you are not willing to change, then we should separate.~
@1274 = ~Then go. Not as if you are useful anyway.~
@1275 = ~Fine. Give me your equipment and go.~
@1276 = ~I'm not a wicked person, Recorder. Give me a chance to show you.~
@1277 = ~You...you are...such an ass! Goodbye!~
@1278 = ~If that is what you want...have it. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@1279 = ~I...I can stay and see. Oghma forgive me if I am gullible, but I will give you a chance.~
@1280 = ~You lied to me. Lied to me! You're just using me. And I hate that. I have been used enough in my life, and I won't take more of it!~
@1281 = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. But our time together is over.~
@1282 = ~Hey.~ [X3RCON1]
@1283 = ~Let me ask you a question.~
@1284 = ~I want to talk about something personal.~
@1285 = ~May I ask you to play something for me?~
@1286 = ~Never mind.~
@1287 = ~I'm with you.~ [X3RCom2]
@1288 = ~I have something I want to ask.~
@1289 = ~Go on.~ [X3RCom4]
@1290 = ~Very well.~ [X3RCon6]
@1291 = ~You are originally from Lantan, yes? Do you remember much of your time there?~
@1292 = ~Do you know much about Athkatla?~
@1293 = ~Could I call you Rebecca instead?~
@1294 = ~Do you regret giving birth to your son?~
@1295 = ~So what does a Lorekeeper like yourself usually do?~
@1296 = ~Let's talk about something else.~
@1297 = ~Never mind. Let's keep moving.~
@1298 = ~Please, take your time.~ [X3RCom3]
@1299 = ~That's all I had to ask. Let's keep moving.~
@1300 = ~I spent almost my entire childhood there, so yes. It is...different than the rest of the world. There is such an emphasis on working hard and pushing to the next great discovery, the next great technological achievement.~
@1301 = ~Many of my people have a reputation for being eccentric, but I think it is because of that beautiful devotion to an art or work. Lantan was all about that.~
@1302 = ~There are colleges and artisan guilds and inventors of flying machines and printing presses and even attempts at non-magic portals. You would be marveled at some of the things created in my homeland.~
@1303 = ~It sounds truly wonderful.~
@1304 = ~Did your people not make room for leisure?~
@1305 = ~All of these things sound so useful. Why aren't they anywhere else?~
@1306 = ~Let me ask you about something else.~
@1307 = ~It wasn't perfect. Sometimes there were rifts with the humans that came over, and...pirates, too. But if you looked past it, it is truly a great place.~
@1308 = ~Did your people make room for leisurely activities?~
@1309 = ~Oh definitely, though often they centered around the very work we valued. For my people, working is leisure. Technology is an art, something to be valued and prized.~
@1310 = ~Even if I was never as good at the sciences and inventions of my people, I always had a large respect for my people who were great at it.~
@1311 = ~A lot of the inventions you've mentioned sound interesting or useful Why aren't they anywhere else?~
@1312 = ~Some of these are just at their beginning stages. I think for others, it is a matter of trust. We have an invention called the gonne for example, which shoots a sort of object with gunpowder that shatters on content. If mass produced, it could be devastating in the wrong hands. A few have already landed in less than savory arms.~
@1313 = ~Still, I hope one day the world is in a better place where we can trust them to take the things we trade them and use them for good purposes.~
@1314 = ~Let's keep moving.~
@1315 = ~Yes. I could tell you about any of the districts. Is there one in particular you are interested in?~
@1316 = ~Tell me about the slums.~
@1317 = ~Tell me about the Bridge District.~
@1318 = ~Tell me about the Temple District.~
@1319 = ~Tell me about the Government District.~
@1320 = ~Anything interesting of the area around the city gates?~
@1321 = ~Can you tell me about the Promenade?~
@1322 = ~They are where most of the poor squeeze into. Buildings on top of buildings, some people can't even afford the housing allotted there.~
@1323 = ~It is also a place frequented by the criminal oriented. I would watch our backs if you have us go through there.~
@1324 = ~The Bridge district is the middle of Althkata. You can almost see the transition from wealth to poor in how some of the housing is split.~
@1325 = ~My favorite place in the Bridge District is the playhouse. I know your purpose here isn't one for relaxation, but...it is certainly worth a visit. The performers always put on a great show.~
@1326 = ~The Temple district is where most of the well financed faiths make their temples. You'll find Helm, Talos, and Lathander with their priests there. They don't always get along, but the guards keep any squabbles off the streets.~
@1327 = ~The wondrous Radiant Heart is here too. I...wish Sir Harmon had a chance to see it. It's an impressive building full of some of the best paladin warriors in the realms, though I don't think he would have fit in very well.~
@1328 = ~The government district is where most of the government of the city is quartered. It is the richest district, and many noble houses make their homes around it.~
@1329 = ~It is also the strictest on crime, and the prison is in this district.~
@1330 = ~No, not really. Just an inn and the gate itself to go to and from the city. We aren't merchants, so we shouldn't be bothered.~
@1331 = ~People come from all over to see the Promenade. It is *the* sight of Althkata. Visitors will stay at the inn, tour the markets, see the circus, view the exotic animals, maybe even make a few purchases.~
@1332 = ~No visitor's stay is complete without visiting the Promenade. Even nobles just here on business almost always stop by there.~
@1333 = ~I am sorry, but I would not be comfortable with that.~
@1334 = ~I understand.~
@1335 = ~Why not?~
@1336 = ~But I like it better than Recorder.~
@1337 = ~Your parents gave you that name. Why would you forego it?~
@1338 = ~ It is just that...I am not "Rebecca" anymore. I have worked so hard to be a different person that...I am more or less the image I have adopted for myself.~
@1339 = ~It has not stopped me from remembering my past. It will always haunt me. And that is why I do not want to be called Rebecca.~
@1340 = ~You don't have to say anymore. I understand your reasons.~
@1341 = ~That sounds cowardly to me. It's just a name.~
@1342 = ~Thank you. I appreciate that very much.~
@1343 = ~Call me a coward if you wish. But I refuse...I *cannot* acknowledge it. I am sorry.~
@1344 = ~That is a very...difficult question. I don't regret the tender moments I held him in my arms. I just wish it was a different place, and a different father.~
@1345 = ~I am sorry. I...can't talk more about that. It is a very...hard conversation for me.~
@1346 = ~We are what we are, truly: Lorekeepers. We gather the stories and the history of what is going on now or what happened into parchment and tomes for the church's records.~
@1347 = ~Some of us focus solely on the past, being reciters and advisors when called upon for the temple or the city or nation we are from.~
@1348 = ~I focus on the present. Many of those who are more like me follow adventurers in their travels to pick up stories, or record a story of someone who may make an impact of the realm.~
@1349 = ~You believe I am a force of change, then?~
@1350 = ~Do you have any other works you have done besides myself?~
@1351 = ~Yes. Very much so. You saved Baldur's Gate. If you were not there, the entire Swordcoast would be going through a much different time.~
@1352 = ~And if you were not in Amn right now, I cannot help but feel the history that is to come would be following a different course.~
@1353 = ~Erm, no, I am afraid. I had something attempted on the old Ulcaster School but...that ended poorly. I have only recorded your travels so far. You have made quite the impact.~
@1354 = ~If you were not at Baldur's Gate all that time ago, the entire Swordcoast would be going through a much different time. And if you were not in Amn right now, I cannot help but feel the history that is to come would be following a different course.~
@1355 = ~More and more I feel that your path isn't fully by chance, that you are carrying something great. I just cannot yet see what it is.~
@1356 = ~It is not just the two of us, but please, ask.~
@1357 = ~Back in Dragonspear...is there still anything between us?~
@1358 = ~I'd like to spend time together when we next make to rest.~
@1359 = ~(Kiss her)~
@1360 = ~I just wanted to say how enchanting your voice is.~
@1361 = ~I'm sorry Recorder, but I don't think we are going to work out.~
@1362 = ~Nothing actually. Let's keep moving.~
@1363 = ~It is just the two of us. Please, ask.~
@1364 = ~I would love the company, <CHARNAME>, as long as it's an inn, or the outdoors. I look forward to it.~
@1365 = ~My love, I would cherish that. We can do this when we rest in an inn or the outdoors. A dungeon wouldn't be as safe.~
@1366 = ~Mmm. Your kisses always make my heart sing.~
@1367 = ~That is kind of you. I am not the perfect performer, even if I have always been interested in the singing arts.~
@1368 = ~There's no need to be modest. You have the voice of an angel.~
@1369 = ~I imagine you studied as a bard?~
@1370 = ~Do you have other musical talents besides singing and play the flute?~
@1371 = ~You are making me blush. I...am grateful for your compliment. Ah, let me cover my cheeks, I feel so red.~
@1372 = ~I did. I had a private tutor. It was mainly the flute, though I learned the harp and lute as well.~
@1373 = ~I don't have the latter two instruments with me to show you how I play on them, but someday, I would love to show you.~
@1374 = ~I can play the harp and the lute, although I don't have them with me to show you.~
@1375 = ~One day though, I would love to play them, at least for you, since you are such an admirer. One day.~
@1376 = ~I...*sigh*. Can I ask what I did wrong?~
@1377 = ~We're just not compatible like I thought.~
@1378 = ~You're a bit annoying to be honest.~
@1379 = ~It's not you. It's me.~
@1380 = ~I'd rather not say.~
@1381 = ~I...I understand. I will treasure the memory, even if I am in pain right now.~
@1382 = ~I am going to give you privacy. Excuse me.~
@1383 = ~I...guess I don't know what to say that. I am just going to leave you alone, then. I'm sorry I was...annoying.~
@1384 = ~But I am not unhappy with you. I don't care if you feel imperfect or a burden. I will support you always, if you let me.~
@1385 = ~No matter how hard things get, or hopeless, I don't want you to pull away. Pull closer to me.~
@1386 = ~Very well. I will take your advice.~
@1387 = ~I'm sorry Recorder. I'm decided.~
@1388 = ~I am glad you see reason. I'm not ready for this to end. We still have so many stories together.~
@1389 = ~I would be happy to. I hope my performance is to your liking.~
