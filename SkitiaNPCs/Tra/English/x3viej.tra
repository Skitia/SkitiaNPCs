@2    = ~Pure evil! You are no better than Irenicus! I will protect her from you.~
@3    = ~I am sorry, but I stand with Emily. I can't let you do this.~
@4    = ~For my people, and my city!~
@5    = ~It is the same reason why we do not allow outsiders in Evermeet, though Evermeet needs no one. But we are here now to help, priestess.~
@6    = ~Such ambition reminds me so much of my own when I was young. Never have I more appreciated my homeland's mercy than now.~
@7    = ~Yes, it's this mutt. Don't we have business to get to?~
@8    = ~Gentle, "caring", the mutt said? Is there any grey matter in his head?~
@9    = ~Ugh, another drow. Be on your guard.~
@10   = ~You chose the wrong enemy, drow.~
@11   = ~To battle, my friends!~
@12   = ~Be very careful whose power you underestimate, dwarf.~
@13   = ~No...another great elven city, destroyed?~
@14   = ~You heard him, dhaerrow. Swear an oath. We should have bound you to one from the start.~
@15   = ~Please. I am from Evermeet, the drow are a mutual enemy, kin.~
@16   = ~So you say, but you bear the mark of shame upon your forehead. You are no more trustable than the rest of your group!~
@17   = ~Please. I am from Evermeet, the drow are a mutual enemy, kin. Viconia just happens to be a useful exception.~
@18   = ~Let us find them quickly. The less elven lives lost, the better.~
@19   = ~And you think that you are safe after your game with us? <CHARNAME> has killed far stronger than you.~
@20   = ~I sense a troubling power from that tank. Do as the duergar suggests...for the sake of our work here.~
@21   = ~Oh shut up. Die the death you deserve, drow.~
@22   = ~Noo-!~
@23   = ~Clever. This may prove quite fruitful, if you make your next moves worth the time.~
@24   = ~Make your bargain worthwhile. Preferably a way out of here if you are going to be a fool and anger an ally of the elven people.~
@25   = ~Your foolish decision damns us all, <CHARNAME>!~
@26   = ~I sense an opportunity here, if we speak to the target first. Take my advice or not, but I hate him less than I hate her.~
@27   = ~Vienxay has a point for once. And I really would rather not take another life for these people.~
@28   = ~Ugh. Surely we cannot let this come to pass. Walking the shadowed path can be...constraining sometimes.~
@29   = ~Another mage willing duel? They truly are fools to challenge us.~
@30   = ~The mage duels were...a delight, I suppose. A worthy trial of our power.~
@31   = ~One more victory out to extinguish any further desires of trying against us.~
@32   = ~There are clearly more important things to do. But I would not mind proving my superiority if that is your request.~
@33   = ~If we were in a different place, how I would seek rightful revenge.~
@34   = ~Did your companion speak? I only heard a murmur.~
@35   = ~I did not. Continue.~

@39   = ~Are you incapable of even remembering the word "subtlety?"~
@40   = ~I do not think you could have made this any worse, <CHARNAME>.~
@41   = ~Ugh. This is going swimmingly.~
@42   = ~I would love to get my revenge on these creatures, but I know a losing fight.~
@43   = ~What tipped you off? The fact they have power over our minds? Not even fair! Damn creepy creatures.~
@44   = ~Such guile. Your intelligence and trickery with them is quite remarkable.~
@45   = ~Well done. The subtle art of deception is not lost upon you. Let us be away from here.~
@46   = ~We were better off not throwing away our coin to them, but whatever. Let us be off.~
@47   = ~This is a worthy cause for revenge. Silvers are friends of Evermeet, and she is also the enemy of our enemy.~
@48   = ~A fitting course of action. May they all fall by your wrath, my lady.~
@49   = ~What did you expect, <CHARNAME>? Now we must fight for our lives!~
@50   = ~To become...a drow? Ugh. The thought is revolting.~
@51   = ~A nuisance, but a temporary one. I am sure our rightful reward awaits for this petty task once this spell has run its course.~
@52   = ~He actually believes you? Even if it is the truth, an impressive feat.~
@53   = ~I suppose I am...grateful my kin is alive. I truly thought death was his only hope.~
@54   = ~To the surface, I go.~
@55   = ~I know no way to help my kin beyond a merciful death. Let us make it quick.~
@56   = ~'Tis better. But hardly our weight of the effort, I say.~
@57   = ~You did not share enough fool, and so we battle.~
@58   = ~You may try. I will end you quickly and mercifully.~
@59   = ~We may both be outcasts, but I have no pity for how this creature treats you, dhaerrow.  Only pleasure.~
@60   = ~Any chance to increase our power with magical of another dimension is a worthy opportunity. Do not discard this chance.~
@61   = ~If we want what he promises, let us work with him. For now.~
@62   = ~An artifact? You have my full attention. Surely it belongs in our hands, after all.~
@63   = ~Clever. We do of course, deserve the highest treatment.~
@64   = ~Please. Keep your suspicions to yourself. I have my ways of forcing you if necessary.~
@65   = ~What? You just can't d-~
@66   = ~Do you have no sense of pretend, mutt? You will get us killed if you do not remember.~
@67   = ~I have no desire to listen to any of your barking, mutt.~
@68   = ~And yet I have a desire to give you a beating, if we were in a different place. Mind yourself most of all, Vienxay.~
@69   = ~The king seems idiotic, though I hardly care about these Sahuagin. But the cause of vengeance knows no boundaries, and that is appealing to me.~
@70   = ~Such fools. I enjoyed this little task, but these creatures are hopeless.~
@71   = ~Please. There is hardly any point in guarding this empty thing. No wizard would desire such a task.~
@72   = ~Vengeance, even on the behalf of another, is very, very, sweet.~
@73   = ~Sometimes I wish you showed even an ounce of cleverness before you sought violent conflict out of boredom. Shadows guard us, the entire city will try to overwhelm us!~
@74   = ~A wise choice to follow along with this for now, <CHARNAME>. We can get our bearings and form a plan, ultimately to our own benefit.~
@75   = ~Let us play along. There could be opportunity here.~
@76   = ~Sometimes I wish you showed even an ounce of cleverness before you sought violent conflict. Shadows guard us, the entire city will try to overwhelm us!~
@77   = ~Perhaps this will make more sense if you bothered to explain why we are here at all.~
@78   = ~By the Seldarine, shut up gnome! We'll never get off the island with you talking and talking like this.~
@79   = ~I am sure that he left out that convenient fact when he asked for us to come along.~
@80   = ~Some of Evermeet's people have come or gone to Suldanessellar. If that is where he is headed, my people are in grave danger.~
@81   = ~Our best chance is with numbers, and the mages would make good meat shields.~
@82   = ~Vienxay is right, though it isn't about sacrificing these other mages. But alone, we don't have as good of a chance.~
@83   = ~I've given my advice. Good luck.~
@84   = ~An elf does not belong in the Underdark. Let us take the ship, it is the wisest course of action.~
@85   = ~You should remember Vienxay. Do you recognize her, Imoen?~
@86   = ~Please, I do not know why you are bothering. Her mind has been addled. No hopeful words will change that.~
@87   = ~Hrmph. I am capable of leaving this place, with shadows at my beckoning. 'Tis not my preference, but the offer is there.~
@88   = ~I will pray for you kin. You do not deserve what has happened to you.~
@89   = ~If he be a dwarf, ye would have said naught.~
@90   = ~What I say or do not say is not your concern. There is nothing to be done here, for now. Let us...carry on, or whatever.~
@91   = ~This is no place for my kind. He should have been brought to Evermeet if anything, but as if these humans would care.~
@92   = ~Her endless terror is of no surprise to me. To be pitied, I suppose.~
@93   = ~Did I hear right? Vienxay showing a bit of pity?~
@94   = ~Unless you are deaf. Why is it that it must be such a remarkable thing?~
@95   = ~He means it's nice. The poor girl. I wish there was something we could do.~
@96   = ~Even from what I have seen on the Shadow Plane, there are creatures to fear. From all planes at once? Her endless terror is no surprise.~
@97   = ~I know first hand about magical accidents. Something like this seems to hardly qualify.~
@98   = ~Get me away from this brat. What a disturbing child.~
@99   = ~You should be very afraid right now, human woman. Very.~
@100  = ~Inconvenient. We were a moment away from learning what was needed.~
@101  = ~Right, murders are inconvenient, I imagine. Have some sympathy for the fallen.~
@102  = ~On your guard. Someone else is in control of this man.~
@103  = ~I have no tolerance for traitors. I dare you to try to escape my Shadowbolt.~
@104  = ~It could have been worse. I did make a few coins with my...talents.~
@105  = ~I was tiring of his company anyway. No doubt it would have only given us more problems.~
@106  = ~She plays the same word game as my mentor. I hate such people.~
@107  = ~What a fool. You speak your plan that anyone can hear you. Your fate is sealed.~
@108  = ~Crawling? Quite unnecessary when the weave is at your fingertips.~
@109  = ~You use magic to aid your thievery? You will have to tell me all about it sometime, perhaps over some tea?~
@110  = ~No interest. Now go away.~
@111  = ~Human greediness! He dares ask for more work after taking our coin.~
@112  = ~Ugh, a prison for magi? I would rather not go there at all, but if we must.~
@113  = ~What are we, watchers for children now? I hope these "errands" end soon.~
@114  = ~Please, none of us care. There are more important things than the slobs on the street.~
@115  = ~You...you are an awful, awful elf, Vienxay.~
@116  = ~Yes, you humans have said that before. It is getting old.~
@117  = ~For the best. They are humans, after all. One risks a shorter life with over-association.~
@118  = ~That isn't what I meant Vienxay, I- never mind.~
@119  = ~Evermeet would never allow such activities. Vengeance should be swift and clean, though I can see how a slow death can be pleasurable.~
@120  = ~There is something off with his mind. Though it is hardly our problem. Let us move along.~
@121  = ~Are you truly a fool? He deserves everything that comes to him. Read the scroll and be done with it.~
@122  = ~I would have called you a fool in the past for doing this. Yet I trust in our combined power, though I would still advice the scroll over this.~
@123  = ~Hrmph. Then their fate is quite deserved.~
@124  = ~They more than deserve what they have in mind. We are no one's pawns.~
@125  = ~Such power! I can feel it...beware. Whatever is here is nothing that I have ever felt before.~
@126  = ~This lowly imp is our challenge? This will be boringly easy.~
@127  = ~One can hardly blame him. I would have done the same if it was my master.~
@128  = ~Hrmph. If you ask why I am upset later, I will point to this precise moment.~
@129  = ~Hrmph, I have no desire to hurt someone so w- what are you doing? Stand still and stop being a nuisance! I'll use my art if I must.~
@130  = ~I have no appreciation of being used and manipulated. And yet you will try to wave this away with words, I am sure.~
@131  = ~And he acts as if it is our fault, when this was clearly his duty. Humans!~
@132  = ~As if this imp could do much of anything to deter us. Still, it may know something.~
@133  = ~I almost hate admitting this, but I'd rather be stuck alone with her in any realm than you in the most pleasant place, dwarf.~
@134  = ~Awakened? Ominous enough. Do provide more details.~
@135  = ~Even if I do not care for these people, I am...happy for them. Jealous even.~
@136  = ~Hrngh. By Moradin, I feel bad for the elf. This be nay right at all.~
@137  = ~You fool! This will earn nothing but the Seldarine's condemnation. I may have done horrible things, but you have done something even worse. Whatever consequences come, face them without me.~
@138  = ~My people have a respect for nature that I will not abandon just because of my exile, <CHARNAME>.  So my advice is simple: Don't be a fool. Don't use the poison.~
@139  = ~Vienxay isn't the only one who sees this as wrong. We can't poison the grove. We have to find another way.~
@140  = ~Hurry up now, hurry up!~
@141  = ~A practiced lie. I can sense shadows and illusions about her, <CHARNAME>, potent ones at that. What are you really, false human?~
@142  = ~I do not care. I am *not* going to carry that thing. Disgusting!~
@143  = ~I...feel bad for the instrument. Oh, the poor thing will probably never sound the same.~
@144  = ~Again, sorry for the smell.~
@145  = ~He could easily be asking it for himself for future leverage. I distrust his motive.~
@146  = ~It is oddly nice to be appreciated. I even find myself looking for more opportunities to be heralded...it is almost strange.~
@147  = ~You've gotten rid of an annoying human and profited from it. A worthwhile moment of work for you.~
@148  = ~Remember, don't tell anyone!~
@149  = ~Oh, an elf! Huh, what is that tattoo on your head for?~
@150  = ~It...it is just a marking child. To remember everything that I miss. Now, leave me be, if you would, please.~
@151  = ~A senseless death. It is better to live than to die right...even if his philosophy was clearly flawed.~
@152  = ~Hurry up, Huntley!~
@153  = ~If you must ask...yes. Please. Stop. Annoying. Us!~
@154  = ~I am sure we could easily dispatch these genies. But I am far more interested in pursuing this Rakshasa. Such a rare and interesting encounter it would be.~
@155  = ~I was pleased we got to defeat a Rakshasa. I suppose the town is pleased too, but I hardly care.~
@156  = ~I see no taint of shadow on this one. But the choice is ultimately yours.~
@157  = ~This is certainly possibly within the realm of shadow magic, though 'tis a darker source than even my own.~
@158  = ~Predictable, that a greedy human uses his wealth to fuel his claim and obsession of ownership.~
@159  = ~I have suspected the cowled wizards are nothing but manipulators. The question is if we care: even I am curious of these magical secrets.~
@160  = ~And now the truth revealed. If you ask my opinion, I have no love of the cowled wizards and would be in glee if denied them this man.~
@161  = ~One day, one day, Vienxay you might just say: "Because it's the right thing to do" and not "I get to enjoy someone else's pain."~
@162  = ~Amusing. A well taught lesson, <CHARNAME>.~
@163  = ~As if he could truly stop his daughter from doing what she wanted. I did all sorts of things with boys back in Evermeet under my father's nose.~
@164  = ~And all sorts of images have now entered my head that I never wanted. Thank you, Vienxay.~
@165  = ~Ogres, wolves, and a witch. None of these sound like the truth. More likely it is a human gone mad, as it typically is.~
@166  = ~You dare betray us, human? It will be the last thing you do.~
@167  = ~I hope you have a plan. I have little desire for being endless hunted by a paladin order.~
@168  = ~More like hard work. This is what they want, let them earn it. The best possible decision.~
@169  = ~Well, it's nice to know you at least are a proponent for love, even if you aren't for a bit of charity, Vienxay.~
@170  = ~She deserves death anyway. I have not met a more annoying human in my life.~
@171  = ~I tire of listening to you. Kill me already.~
@172  = ~Please. I am as of noble blood as you are. Not that you would know a thing about my family.~
@173  = ~Bringing her along would be a mistake. But I suppose I could be a good role model if necessary.~
@174  = ~Ha, funny one, Vienxay. I'm all for another half-elf! Er, even if I'm not *quite* half-elf, anyway.~
@175  = ~Ugh. Now I want her along even less.~
@176  = ~Please, is it not obvious? This is an illusion. Let us move on.~
@177  = ~This human makes no sense. Why are we even here helping her? I see no profit in this.~
@178  = ~This human tries my patience. Let us see him ruined!~
@179  = ~The cause of revenge is deliciously sweet indeed.~
@180  = ~It is a fool to let this man walk. You will come to regret this decision.~
@181  = ~Hrmph, good for her. Why do we care? Why are we even listening to this?~
@182  = ~Let him cast it. I want to see him miserably fail.~
@183  = ~And why are we letting it have it when there is a better mage in this party? He is going to screw something up with it.~
@184  = ~Cease your prattle. It is my idea and thus my work. If you even think about swiping it, there will be a fireball in your bedroll. Mine. (Yes, very much mine.)~
@185  = ~His screeching is annoying. Can we move on? I have no care for human relationships.~
@186  = ~I despise being manipulated like this. Have your secrecy, elf kin, though I loath you for it.~
@187  = ~It could also be the work of a bored wizard. Commoners however, will hardly try to make due with actual research.~
@188  = ~He speaks as if he is deserving of respect. I think not.~
@189  = ~Ugh. It's the man who reeks of dead once again, and yet he dares calls us unwashed.~
@190  = ~You haven't died yet, elf? Disappointing.~
@191  = ~Typical Humans betraying one another at the beck and call of their own personal pursuits. My people would never do this.~
@192  = ~Huh. Now that you mention it, you are more loyal than this fellow is, Vienxay.~
@193  = ~This shall require all of our ability, might, and mind to prevail. Lead us well, <CHARNAME>. We will get no second chances.~
@194  = ~I have no scruples about doing what is necessary. If we aim to impress, we should take it.~
@195  = ~I hope you know what you are doing, throwing away such an opportunity.~
@196  = ~A good decision from the sounds of it. If this creature follows through on its promises.~
@197  = ~The reduced gold is a bargain. And I am curious on what we will learn here.~
@198  = ~I sense an odd power coming from her. I can't describe it. There is more here than it seems.~
@199  = ~This commoner should handle his own problems. There is no gain from helping him.~
@200  = ~Not everyone has the capabilities like we do, Vienxay. Honestly, you could learn some compassion.~
@201  = ~Bless you once again, and good luck!~
@202  = ~Disgusting vermin. Let us eradicate them and the drow both.~
@203  = ~Do as you wish with this fool. He deserves no sway to his judgment.~
@204  = ~Ugh, I find myself pitying the beggar of all things. The guard could surely focus his efforts on something more important.~
@205  = ~Huh. Vienxay actually caring about the poor? That's new.~
@206  = ~And hardly your concern. Let us...leave him to his fate, I suppose.~
@207  = ~I have no doubt that there are few mages of my equal here in this skill-poor city.~
@208  = ~I would put your theory to the test. But you are a human whose knowledge is a fraction of mine. The outcome is already certain.~
@209  = ~You, tiefling are asking help from the best. You *will* concede to our leader's demands.~
@210  = ~Tieflings deserve no less than this.~
@211  = ~At least she has fine taste in wine.~
@212  = ~Keep your coins to yourself, <CHARNAME>. I doubt he'll even buy bread with your offering, waste as it is.~
@213  = ~Hrmph. Pointless. And we have to dirty ourselves in a sewer?~
@214  = ~I don't know, it could be fun. The quest for the gong!~
@215  = ~Call me crazy, but I agree with Vienxay. Not much glory to be had here.~
@216  = ~Do as you will, but I think this is a waste of time. His bad decision leads to consequences he must take on himself.~
@217  = ~And here I thought elves were kind. Come on, let's look for it. How hard could it possibly be to find?~
@218  = ~You there. Watch yourself, or you might wind up behind bars again.~
@219  = ~Worry about somebody else. I am determined to see that experience never repeat itself.~
@220  = ~Ooh...come with me, elfie, or *hic* I'll arrest you.~
@221  = ~Ugh, no. I am done with cells or anything this disgusting human has in mind.~
@222  = ~Nay one more time? That sounds good to me.~
@223  = ~I suggest you watch yourself, dwarf, before I suggest to the drunk that you might be a better target for his drunken advances.~
@224  = ~Surely there must only be air in that naive head of yours, human.~
@225  = ~Hrmph. The humans here really need to get this government together.~
@226  = ~It isn't so easy as that, Vienxay. Maybe we can look into this, <CHARNAME>. This killer...no one should live around someone like that.~
@227  = ~Please. Anyone who tries is asking for a quick end.~
@228  = ~You look beautiful, even for an elf. Would you stay a while? I tire waiting for Oriona, and here you are.~
@229  = ~And here I depart. I've no interest in old men. Stare longingly at another, or keep waiting. Your heart is due to break either way.~
@230  = ~I would never make this sort of agreement with a human. And these cowled wizards are even less trustable.~
@231  = ~And now enticement with magical power...that makes it difficult to say no.~
@232  = ~Finally. I hated the needless restrictions to use my own art. The cost is well worth it, <CHARNAME>.~
@233  = ~Hrmph, if I can just borrow gold on a whim, I will be keeping that in mind.~
@234  = ~I approve of this decision. I tire of the city, and the forest sounds like a far better place.~
@235  = ~Speak for yerself. But if there be forest creatures that be a worthy challenge, I be nay complaining.~
@236  = ~Put out your eyes! Feel the holiness of true sight!~
@237  = ~Ugh! Get away from me.~
@238  = ~You made the right choice. My people have fought them for generations. They deserve nothing less.~
@239  = ~Ugh, saving her was a mistake. Keeping her along, a bigger one. She should have burned.~
@240  = ~And what have I done to you? Despite your animosity, I have not harmed a darthiir.~
@241  = ~I doubt that.~
@242  = ~And just when I thought my time on away from Evermeet couldn't get worse.~
@243  = ~I would rather not be in your company either, darthiir, but we are not enemies.~
@244  = ~A burning of a drow? Delightful. Let's stay and watch.~
@245  = ~If we save her, we can't watch her burn. I hardly see the fun in that.~
@246  = ~Ugh, the pit stinks of rot and filth. I will have to pay this beholder back for the disgusting muck that will get on my robes.~
@247  = ~I was hoping for something magnificent, even if it is from a human god, but we get something rather useless. This plan better work.~
@248  = ~I am curious what gives the beholder the need to ask for help. It is certainly a curiosity worth our time, if we proceed cautiously.~
@249  = ~Hrmph, I am sure he knows, and is merely not saying what it is.~
@250  = ~It is a rare thing, but this priest is making some sense.~
@251  = ~Ye're going to convert from yer precious elf gods, then, point ears?~
@252  = ~No, and don't call me point ears. I'll not tolerate that.~
@253  = ~Hrmph. Who cares what humans worship? This is a waste of time.~
@254  = ~A wise choice. We have so many things to do, and so little time. Humans and their issues with faith is the lowest of them to consider.~
@255  = ~He isn't an elf god, for starters.~
@256  = ~Do no humans have a sense of art and beauty?~
@257  = ~Oh, you just haven't been in the right temple, Vienxay. One day!~
@258  = ~Hrmph. Passing on deals because they are stolen. As if supporting the price gouging of other merchants is the better road.~
@259  = ~What idiocy. This human is unworthy of life.~
@260  = ~Rarrgh!~
@261  = ~Ugh, are you a fool? The man is worthy of death. It is but one more step!~
@262  = ~Bah, I find meself agreeing with the elf, and I bloody hate that. We should see the bastard dead.~
@263  = ~For the love of the Seldarine. As you were saying, human?~
@264  = ~Work like this will suit my talents well. Lean on me if you must, <CHARNAME>, subterfuge is my specialty.~
@265  = ~Too bad keeping yer mouth shut, ain't. Yer nose is up in the bloody skies.~
@266  = ~You are turning down a profitable opportunity. I have no idea what you are thinking.~
@267  = ~Supporting thieves on the Docks is not what Althkata needs. They've caused hardship on the temple of Oghma in the past.~
@268  = ~And who cares about a couple of books gnome? All your faith cares about as I understand is the spreading of knowledge. This is coin, and coin is far more versatile in its usefulness.~
@269  = ~Ugh. *Giggle* this, *giggle* that. All her grey matter is full of air.~
@270  = ~You're just jealous, Vienxay. Damn, I wish I was that guy.~
@271  = ~Ugh, spare us the screeching. He's in the back rooms, fondling another human. Quite disgusting.~
@272  = ~This blade must be really special if it is guarded by riddles. 'Tis no magic tome however, and thus I have little interest.~
@273  = ~I don't need to be a master of shadows to tell you how much better subtlety is in this sort of situation.~
@274  = ~Ugh. Another human who coddles the poor. Let's see how long she can even survive.~
@275  = ~Even one coin is something you could be saving up for far better use.~
@276  = ~What an idiot. Show him true power, <CHARNAME>.~
@277  = ~Hey! Pretty elf with the tattoo on her head!~
@278  = ~Pretty? You have my attention.~
@279  = ~Yes, you! See this mighty fine sphere here? You can have it for your very own for a mere 500 gold pieces! What do you say?~
@280  = ~I say you are wasting my time. Con somebody else.~
@281  = ~We have better things to do than waste gold on worthless commoners.~
@282  = ~This is clearly a con. A waste of time.~
@283  = ~Fools fear what they do not understand, peasant. Achieve understanding and you will know magic is to be embraced.~
@284  = ~I do not see much of a choice. We can play along and raise some gold, and if we change our minds, we can keep it for ourselves.~
@285  = ~Finally, we get to meet the true power. No more games, and finally answers on what has this group so interested.~
@286  = ~Please, enough with the sob story. Ask him for the secrets to his power.~
@287  = ~They do, I admit. Unfortunate that they also have that awful Madam Yuth.~
@288  = ~There is certainly a power in the air here. I say we should see to this ourselves, if at least to sate my curiosity on what magic is involved here.~
@289  = ~Snub me? Please, I'll snub you.~
@290  = ~Right, because that makes all the difference. Let's just move on and deal with more important things.~
@291  = ~The avariel. Regal, grand, and certainly deserving of some assistance.~
@292  = ~Please, do not torment my kin. Give it to her and let this be over with.~
@293  = ~If even Vienxay is saying this is wrong, it's wrong.~
@294  = ~Hrmph. This Count is hardly a catch as it is.~
@295  = ~You! Have you ever been cheated here? I bet ye have!~
@296  = ~Yes, to my great irritation. But I *always*, make them pay.~
@297  = ~You! Another of that horrible race! You dare approach me, elf?~
@298  = ~Excuse me. But mind how you talk to your betters.~
@299  = ~Your betters?! Arrogant, evil! You will lead us all to the nine hells if you could.~
@300  = ~There is hardly a reason to be jealous. We are older, more beautiful, and hardly evil. All things I am glad to take pride in.~
@301  = ~You admit to it! You admit to your hubris of arrogance!~
@302  = ~Ugh, I tire of his shrieking. Let us be gone from this peasant.~
@303  = ~If we had seen some, why would we share something so useful with you?~
@304  = ~Why y- wait, weren't you thrown out?~
@305  = ~Temporarily. Money tends to change fortunes here, it seems.~
@306  = ~Perhaps <PRO_HESHE> that is with you will be less awful. You, do you see any salamander dust?~
@307  = ~But if that elf that is with you causes anymore trouble, and I won't sell you a thing.~
@308  = ~Ugh, I hate this human. I will be standing away from her. Shop with her if you must, I'm sure we can find the same wares elsewhere.~
@309  = ~No, I am sure you could not. Take a look and see for yourself.~
@310  = ~Ask the arrogant elf. I have seen her taken care of myself.~
@311  = ~Ugh, she deserved it. But I will be on better behavior this time, as long as Lady Yuth is in turn.~
@312  = ~Good. Now move along.~
@313  = ~"There once was an elf so awful,
That she received the boot from those who were lawful.
Wandered and wander did she went,
And angrier and angrier did she vent
But a chance to return may come from a role model."~
@314  = ~What utter nonsense. Explain yourself!~
@315  = ~Please. I doubt any of your humans could sufficiently please me. Ask someone else.~
@316  = ~Greetings, my <LADYLORD>. I am Madame Nin, and I am here to ensure you are pleasantly accompanied. Are you interested in companionship, my <LADYLORD>?~
@317  = ~Please, <CHARNAME> is completely uninterested in any of your simple pleasure workers. Bother somebody else.~
@318  = ~My sweet elf. I sense your intelligence is equaled only by your own beauty.~
@319  = ~Is that it? You need to work on your lines.~
@320  = ~The sheen of light on your skin, the shimmering color in your eyes mesmerizes me.~
@321  = ~I suppose I am enjoying the attention...~
@322  = ~You are? Perhaps we could find somewhere private, then?~
@323  = ~Tempting, but I am going to save myself a subpar experience and say no. You would be a poor lover at best, too inexperienced and fumbling. Go away.~
@324  = ~Ah, you bear both the mark and the weight of an exile. You long for a second chance, always thinking of your homeland. Give up power, and you may find the way home again.~
@325  = ~I will find my own way home, without giving up any of my hard earned power. But your...divinations are still somewhat appreciated.~
@326  = ~Your time ticks, Yoshimo. We *will* have revenge.~
@327  = ~You look as if you are about to fall down. Snap out of it. What's going on?~
@328  = ~There's nothing wrong with me.~
@329  = ~I'm fine. Just... a bit dizzy.~
@330  = ~Something's not right. I think Irenicus did something to me.~
@331  = ~I can tell you are hiding details. Just keep on your feet until we get out of here. Else we may never get out of this place.~
@332  = ~They'll be just fine, Vienxay! We are all here for <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@333  = ~If ye need healing, I'm here. And if ye need to give that bastard a beating, all the better.~
@334  = ~Well, hate to be the pessimistic one, but...this is shaping out to be quite the misadventure. We need to right our fortunes.~
@335  = ~We have to survive. No. We will survive, together.~
@336  = ~By All the Seldarine! <CHARNAME>, what have you become?~
@337  = ~What is going on now? <CHARNAME>? Answer me.~
@338  = ~Get away from me, I'm turning!~
@339  = ~It's coming again, Vienxay! Run while you can!~
@340  = ~I feel... strange...~
@341  = ~Be more s- ...By Mystra!~
@342  = ~You need to stop doing that, <CHARNAME>. Grr, that human mage had to have done this! Infuriating!~
@343  = ~Such power could be useful...but could also kill you if you can't control it. But if you cannot control it, then we must find a way to fix this, or we both shall die from your power.~
@344  = ~<CHARNAME>. Tell me, why are you being foolish and flirting with a drow?!~
@345  = ~Someone's green with envy.~
@346  = ~It's part of my plan, Vienxay, to gain a bit of trust. Nothing more.~
@347  = ~This isn't any of your business.~
@348  = ~Whatever. Just tell me why are you being so foolish?~
@349  = ~Hrmph. I suppose such could work...though it could easily backfire. Take care of your game.~
@350  = ~If you wish to be a fool, then be a fool! I will not bring it up further, for now.~
@351  = ~My companion, Vienxay.~
@352  = ~Well, look who it is.~ [X3BLANK]
@353  = ~You slept with a drow. Please, you don't need to say it. You reek of the filth~
@354  = ~I will say that it disgusted me. I do not think I will dare become close with a drow sleeper. Let us talk no more of this!~
@355  = ~Well, that was short. Good. Whatever. Not that I was concerned, or anything.~
@356  = ~Let's return to our task here. The sooner we get out of this awful place, the better.~
@357  = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@358  = ~Consider that...awful elf, Vienxay. I understand you have gotten close, somehow. I can't imagine what it will feel like when you are torn apart.~
@359  = ~Oh, you bore me, vampire. <CHARNAME> has already proven <PRO_HISHER> strength is greater than yours.~
@360  = ~It is you who should be afraid, Vienxay!~
@361  = ~I know what you intend! You underestimate my own power!~
@362  = ~What?! Forget about her. Deal with them.~
@363  = ~That bitch! The Shadowplane here is horrid in a place like a graveyard. Did you already defeat her?~
@364  = ~Vienxay, you are all right!~
@365  = ~Wait, what happened to you?~
@366  = ~No. She fled, likely into her hideout. Likely preparing for our arrival.~
@367  = ~Of course I am all right. I am not stupid. I know very well the dangerous charms of a vampire.~
@368  = ~I went into the Shadowplane, before she could take over my mind with her power. It worked splendidly, though the Shadowplane often is very similar to the place you left. Suffice to say, I am not keen to do that again.~
@369  = ~No matter. It is time for our revenge. No one dares to destroy this couple and lives! Let us see to this vampire's end.~
@370  = ~Nobody tries to turn me! Consider this revenge.~
@371  = ~Aye, if anyone takes the bloody elf out of the group, it's me.~
@372  = ~We will have revenge. Your end is coming.~
@373  = ~Vienxay, the elf who you whisked away from a fate behind bars. Her debt is perhaps more than repaid, though here she is still.~
@374  = ~Vienxay, you don't owe me anything further. This is no longer your fight.~
@375  = ~This is it. Are you sure you wish to go with me?~
@376  = ~I need to know that you are ready, Vienxay.~
@377  = ~Please. After all this mage has done to my people? Vengeance shall be had, for us both.~
@378  = ~Irenicus will have the punishment that he should have had all along: death. For you, and for all of those he has made suffer. This I swear.~
@379  = ~Vienxay, the arrogant elf who first traveled with you over a sense of debt, and then perhaps from the closeness you shared. You notice she gives you a roll of her eyes.~
@380  = ~Vienxay-~
@381  = ~Please. Don't bother. This is not just about you anymore. This is about my people. And he will pay for everyone of them.~
@382  = ~But this could also...be the end. I will do all in my power to see that not come to pass. I have come to...truly care about you, and...well, whatever! It is not the time for much mushiness.~
@383  = ~It will be us or him, <CHARNAME>. But I swear I will give him a fight he will never recover from, one way or another.~
@384  = ~Yes! Our power is supreme! But are you normal? Things seem the same.~
@385  = ~Ugh. I... died...but now I am here?! I do not care what lies ahead, let us fight through it all. This is not a fate either of us deserves.~ 
@386  = ~Oh, I have longed for this moment. No more running. This is it. This is the moment where I will have my vengeance, for <CHARNAME> and my people both! Prepare to be overwhelmed by my mastery of the art and shadows both!~
@387  = ~Why does this human city not even have a temple dedicated to Mystra? I miss Evermeet's temples to the Seldarine, but I had hoped at the very least Mystra would have representation.~
@388  = ~Considering their distaste for magic, I would be surprised if they did.~
@389  = ~We can look for one, if you like.~
@390  = ~I did not think you were religious, Vienxay.~
@391  = ~Come, stop whining.~
@392  = ~Kind, but do not bother. I have seen much of the city and there is nothing, and few elven folk as it is, and I do not wish to knock on doors to use their personal shrines.~
@393  = ~Yes, a completely moronic point of view that they have. They are rather hopeless to me sometimes, humans.~
@394  = ~Not terribly, no. I revere them, and I love them, but I am no priestess nor fanatic.~
@395  = ~Fine. I will.~
@396  = ~It is just a way that would help me feel...connected to home. Surely you understand, being far away yourself.~
@397  = ~I do. I think of home all the time.~
@398  = ~I don't. I'm glad to be away from home.~
@399  = ~That is a bit...personal.~
@400  = ~Home is where the heart is. A pity it also brings with it anguish.~
@401  = ~I see. I suppose each of us is different, then. You feel freedom, and I feel anguish.~
@402  = ~Have your privacy if that is your wish. I mean no intrusion.~
@403  = ~We've spoken long enough, I think. Let us carry on.~
@404  = ~I can't believe it! Yes, yes, yes! I, Vienxay, have retrieved the Tome of Myth Drannor.~
@405  = ~Don't forget about the rest of us.~
@406  = ~I'm glad you are happy.~
@407  = ~You are certain this is it?~
@408  = ~Allow me a moment to look through this. I am most curious.~
@409  = ~There's a spell of absorption here. While it would only allow a portion of the contents to be immediately gathered, it could allow any one of us who reads elven to be immediately more knowledgeable of much within it save a few specific arts. Obviously, I would be the best candidate for this.~
@410  = ~The rest of the spells I would never dare try. If we use the tome to absorp it's knowledge, it will likely destroy it. We wouldn't be able to return it to Galadin.~
@411  = ~I long for Evermeet. But who knows if Galadin will keep his word? We could also give it to the Sage, but he already voiced his displeasure of me. That would be a horrible idea.~
@412  = ~We should give it to the Sage or Galadin. It's only right it is returned to your people.~
@413  = ~We should make use of it ourselves. Evermeet has done nothing for you, and doesn't deserve it.~
@414  = ~And what do you want to do, Vienxay?~
@415  = ~Perhaps...perhaps you are right. Despite how I have been ostracized from Evermeet, my people should still have it.~
@416  = ~Let us see the tome returned at last.~
@417  = ~We did get it ourselves. They had no part in it. They didn't even try. It was our power, our greatness, and so we deserve it.~
@418  = ~I could not have done it without you, so I will let you decide which one of us absorbs its  knowledge.~
@419  = ~I want to keep it for myself. But I can see hear what my sisters would think of that in my head. I suppose it would be nice to show my people I think of them, even if Galadin doesn't keep his word. I did something good for them.~
@420  = ~Then let us return it, as you desire.~
@421  = ~I see. Despite your thoughts, I think we should use it for ourselves.~
@422  = ~Let us think about it. We can decide later.~
@423  = ~Right now? It should be ours to use for our own goals. I went and did what they could not send anyone to do. Using it for ourselves may help keep us alive, and in your condition, we need everything we can get.~
@424  = ~Then let's keep it for ourselves, as you desire.~
@425  = ~Despite your thoughts, we should return it.~
@426  = ~Thank you for taking in my input. Home...I may break into tears. Hope has never felt so strong.~
@427  = ~Yes, we can decide later. Using it, giving it to Galadin, or giving it to Sules'terim. The latter seems the worst choice, but you are the leader.~
@428  = ~Thank you for your help earlier, <CHARNAME>. I can't understand why all the humans here trouble me.~
@429  = ~It surely has nothing to do with your attitude.~
@430  = ~The guard was just doing his job.~
@431  = ~They don't like you, and will want any excuse to act on it.~
@432  = ~I can see you're making fun of me, now. They were being mean to me first. I just responded accordingly.~
@433  = ~It's not fair, but sometimes we have to keep our head up.~
@434  = ~You were in the right. A shame there is no justice around here.~
@435  = ~That response was what got you in trouble.~
@436  = ~I don't want to hear you whine about this.~
@437  = ~If he was doing his job, he'd have arrested the shopkeeper, too. That's why I got snippy with him.~
@438  = ~Well that's hardly responsible. A guard shouldn't act on his dislike.~
@439  = ~He shouldn't, but some do.~
@440  = ~You remind me of my sisters when you say that. They would always reassure me and try to keep me from making mistakes. I...miss them. I wish I could see them one more time.~
@441  = ~Precisely. I am so glad someone agrees with me. Hrmph. If things were run by me, I assure you, the world would be perfect.~
@442  = ~Unfortunately, they are not. Perhaps...someday. Some glorious day, that will be different.~
@443  = ~Corruption at its finest. In Evermeet things made sense, and I had family. But I suppose I've gotten used to having no more luxury. How I dreadfully miss it.~
@444  = ~Perhaps someday...some glorious day, I can finally go home.~
@445  = ~That's what the guard said. "Stop whining". People here are so unable to want to listen.~
@446  = ~Perhaps someday...some glorious day, I will achieve the respect I am due.~
@447  = ~Did I tell you why I bothered coming to this filthy Althkata?~
@448  = ~No, you didn't.~
@449  = ~I have a feeling you're about to share anyway.~
@450  = ~I think the city is a fine place, personally.~
@451  = ~I was seeking an elf named Sules'terim, a well known scholar and expert on ancient elven magic in Evermeet. More importantly, he is a high standing member of House Durothil, revered for his mastery of knowledge.~
@452  = ~House Durothil holds great influence on Evermeet's High Council. If I could talk to him and convince him that my punishment was a mistake, he could reverse the decision and help me get back home to Evermeet.~
@453  = ~Unfortunately I was having little luck finding him, and asking storekeepers led to...problems you saw for yourself.~
@454  = ~Are you sure he is here then?~
@455  = ~A scholar? Perhaps someone in the temple of Oghma might know.~
@456  = ~And what if he says no?~
@457  = ~What? If you had hailed from one of the elven cities, <CHARNAME>, you would quickly see how wrong these lesser places are, especially Althkata. Let me tell you why I bothered coming here at all.~
@458  = ~Of course you think that. I'd expect such an opinion of your kind.~
@459  = ~Sules'terim? He visited the Temple of Oghma quite recently. He was quite a delight to have there. My mother might know where he is staying, they spoke quite a bit.~
@460  = ~Look <CHARNAME>, our gnome is useful after all. I would request a visit to the temple to see her mother, then. I want this book for myself, to further my own power.~
@461  = ~I suppose we can make the time.~
@462  = ~There's no need to be rude to Recorder, especially when she's helping you here.~
@463  = ~How does helping you do any of this benefit me?~
@464  = ~We don't have the time, Vienxay.~
@465  = ~Of course I am. More than one person informed me, the information is reliable. I suppose... I suppose the temple of Oghma would be a place to start. That is the human's deity of knowledge, perhaps a place of interest like Sules'terim to stop by.~
@466  = ~The human god of knowledge? I suppose that would be a place to start, though humans tend to be disappointing with their knowledge.~
@467  = ~I would rather be told no than believe I would be told no and never find out. I suppose...the temple of Oghma might be a place to start. That is the human's deity of knowledge, perhaps a place of interest like Sules'terim to stop by.~
@468  = ~I am already eager with anticipation to see if the Temple of Oghma is a good lead. You have no idea how much I miss Evermeet.~
@469  = ~I supppose it doesn't. But it makes me happy, and if you want me to not leer glares at you all day, I would appreciate the aid.~
@470  = ~Hrmph. I am merely remarking that she has not always been the best asset to you. There's no need to get all huffy at me.~
@471  = ~Forget about it. When you find a moment do take us to her mother. If she is as helpful as Recorder says, I will consider apologizing. But only then.~
@472  = ~You would have more friends, if you were not so quick to slap the giving hand.~
@473  = ~You have given nothing yet. When we see your mother, we will see then.~
@474  = ~"Don't have the time.", <PRO_HESHE> says. Fine. I can't force you, but I have nowhere else to go either.~
@475  = ~I hope you reconsider and make the sensible choice. You are our group leader, I will begrudgingly admit. At least for now.~
@476  = ~Do remind me what you are doing in this part of the world. All Amn has shown so far is...how uncultured it is.~
@477  = ~I didn't come here by choice. When I escaped Irenicus, in Althkata is where I found myself.~
@478  = ~I am trying to get back Imoen, with whatever it takes.~
@479  = ~More grumbling about the land, Vienxay? Color me surprised.~
@480  = ~I have every right to. I hate this land. It's not Evermeet...and it never will be. But if you don't want to hear about it, fine.~
@481  = ~I can see it's painful for you to speak of. Have your privacy, as you wish.~
@482  = ~And what do you know of this Irenicus?~
@483  = ~He wants something with me, but I am not yet sure.~
@484  = ~I know he caused me to lose Imoen, and that he will pay for it.~
@485  = ~Nothing except that he is a powerful mage.~
@486  = ~The way you speak of him reminds me of my mentor. After she caused me to get exiled from Evermeet, I hated her. She showed me the dark side of magic, and influenced me in a way I forever regret.~
@487  = ~Imoen. Are you close with her?~
@488  = ~We grew up together, and she's been by my side. She's saved me a couple of times too.~
@489  = ~She's been a nuisance that's followed me around. I don't know how she's survived without me.~
@490  = ~I'd rather not talk about it, if I can, Vienxay.~
@491  = ~That reminds me of my relationship with my sisters. They could be some annoying sometimes, always arguing with my greater intelligence and wisdom. But...they've helped me a time or two. I still remember when they lied for me after our parents found the neighbor's cat in our home I had conjured in practice. I would have never been allowed to further my magic education otherwise.~
@492  = ~All the people we touch in our lives always leave an imprint in our spirits, they say. If it's true, it's been only bothersome. I can never stop thinking about my sisters, never stop hating my mentor. Have I touched you in such a way yet?~
@493  = ~A beautiful elf like yourself? You're hard not to think about sometimes.~
@494  = ~Your nature has definitely been enjoyable to be around. I like you, Vienxay.~
@495  = ~I'm not sure yet. I still don't know you too well.~
@496  = ~Not at all.~
@497  = ~I'm not sure whether to be quite flattered or very careful about prodding on what these thoughts about me are. I'll do both for now, I think. I do like to be thought as beautiful.~
@498  = ~I've not heard such a compliment in too long. I think it is about time I do get some recognition. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I will admit you are an enjoyable companion, at least so far. You may make me miserable later.~
@499  = ~Well, forget it, then. It may just be a bunch of philosophical non-sense I read back in Evermeet. Perhaps it means nothing now. Perhaps a lot of things mean nothing now.~
@500  = ~Do you ever regret leaving home, <CHARNAME>? I suppose your home, as I've understand it, is hardly luxurious, but it is a home.~
@501  = ~If things could have been different, I would stay.~
@502  = ~There isn't much to regret. I had to leave Candlekeep. Often, I find I'm often forced to go away from any sort of place after a while.~
@503  = ~I was never happy in Candlekeep. I'd much rather be adventuring.~
@504  = ~I suppose we are both exiles, in a way.~
@505  = ~Sometimes I wish there was a spell to go back in time. To put yourself back in a moment where everything in your life just came apart.~
@506  = ~I still remember being confronted by my former lover. He was yelling and I let my emotions take over and use a spell I should never have tried.~
@507  = ~Tell me more.~
@508  = ~We can't go back, Vienxay. We can only strive forward.~
@509  = ~So you just murdered him? That's terrible.~
@510  = ~Hrmph, when not given the choice of going to the elven homeland, I would much rather be on the road than any civilization away from Evermeet as well.~
@511  = ~Of course I know that. I hate that. Just one second chance spell. That is all I would want.~
@512  = ~It is so easy to judge when you were not there! My secret was out and I was afraid of my reputation and...I suppose it is foolish now, given all that's passed.~
@513  = ~I used the magic my mentor at the time was trying to teach me to kill him, the shadow weave, which I regret touching now. It tore him apart. It was beautiful and horrifying, its scintillating colors, its pure raw energy just devouring him.~
@514  = ~Every now and again I get the temptation just to feel all that raw power but I've learned its best not to use it. I will not add another spell of its kind to my knowledge, only shadow magic and the standard weave~
@515  = ~You had a different tune, back when we were marching to Dragonspear.~
@516  = ~I'm glad you see that it wasn't a good idea now.~
@517  = ~It's not wrong to use power as you need it.~
@518  = ~Isn't Shadow magic the same thing?~
@519  = ~I did, though that was not even the shadow weave. Besides, I was a criminal practically forced to fight for the expedition if I wanted to be free. I wanted every asset available to survive, and keep you safe.~
@520  = ~So you care about me, do you?~
@521  = ~It has a similar feeling. Sometimes I am worried it might be, and that I have really fallen below the expectations my parents once had of me.~
@522  = ~But no, it is different. It is very different. It is hard to explain, so you will just have to believe me.~
@523  = ~If you say so.~
@524  = ~I'm not sure I like the idea of you using any kind of shadow magic.~
@525  = ~I trust you Vienxay. I am glad you can at least see what is right and wrong now.~
@526  = ~Now hardly means much, does it? I suppose however, I should stop moaning about the past and make sure you don't make any regretful decisions on our journey. Just listen to me and we'll be all right.~
@527  = ~I am an elf, but I am not above liking others, if they prove themselves. And you have so far, at least. I do appreciate your effort.~
@528  = ~You are bearable, but I am here because I feel indebted, not to be your best friend. We have matters to take care of, don't we?~
@529  = ~My people disagree. And every time I exercise power that way, I get punished. It makes me wonder why society celebrates its powerful wizards but punishes those who exercise it. It is truly infuriating.~
@530  = ~There is hardly an if about it if I did, is there? People say such strange things outside of the Green Isle, I swear.~
@531  = ~Well, that is not up for debate. I use it and it keeps me alive. Be grateful that it will also keep you alive.~
@532  = ~After some time in human civilization, at least this civilization around Athkatla, I have come to appreciate some of their ways of life.~
@533  = ~That's very surprising to hear from you.~
@534  = ~Oh? Such as?~
@535  = ~Good. You are finally coming around to the great civilization of the Sword Coast.~
@536  = ~Please. Don't get carried away in your head.~
@537  = ~Am I truly incapable in your mind to make any positive comment about anything? I simply just don't throw out words to please people pointlessly.~
@538  = ~There is an appreciation and ability for one to truly work. Laws are not so restrictive to hold back and bring woe upon the successful. Merchants can advance themselves without constant regard for others.~
@539  = ~In Evermeet it was different. Laws were even less restrictive. But there was always an unspoken regard for charity towards your own people. I did not always enjoy it, though those habits have hardly left me.~
@540  = ~It sounds like you are more at home here, then.~
@541  = ~We should be charitable. If you have more gold than you need, it should not be wasted.~
@542  = ~I agree. I have enjoyed the ways of life here.~
@543  = ~Oh please. The restrictiveness of magic here is completely unacceptable. I would rather be at home, despite my people's hearts being too soft. Though not too soft. My own exile is a reminder of that.~
@544  = ~Wasted? It is simply preserved for one's own needs. I do not say one cannot give if that is what they want. They should simply not feel obligated. Thus my loathing of taxes. It is such a ridiculous human invention.~
@545  = ~It is not all perfect. The restrictiveness of magic here is completely unacceptable. I would rather be at home, despite my people's hearts being too soft. Though not too soft. My own exile is a reminder of that.~
@546  = ~*Sigh*. And here I go off again. I long for my homeland, but I should stop burdening you with my woes. You have enough on your plate.~
@547  = ~I'd rather you open up to me, Vienxay. I want you to trust me, to be close to me.~
@548  = ~Quite. I'd appreciate it if you stopped insulting everything and everyone every chance you get.~
@549  = ~Do as you wish. It doesn't bother me.~
@550  = ~That is...not a request I have ever heard from someone. I confess I also enjoy these chats of ours. But to hear it is warming. It's almost uncomfortable.~
@551  = ~Hrmph, it is hardly *every* chance, but whatever. I will try to heed your words...or ignore them as I see fit.~
@552  = ~In any case, we have other things to do, don't we? I suggest we get back to that.~
@553  = ~How infuriating. My entire purpose for coming to Amn is pointless if the tome is lost. All I wanted was a chance to bring me back to Evermeet's shores, and the Seldarine deny me this! How can I be happy here when I know a home elsewhere?~
@554  = ~You can make a life anywhere, Vienxay. You can find happiness if you try.~
@555  = ~Whining won't help. Keep quiet and let's move.~
@556  = ~I don't know, Vienxay. That's a question only you can answer.~
@557  = ~And what happiness would that be?~
@558  = ~Making the world safer, better, a place you would want others to live in.~
@559  = ~Redemption, and salvaging your name. Making yourself better so that you might be accepted again.~
@560  = ~Knowledge and understanding. Think of the opportunity to travel wherever you wish.~
@561  = ~Ugh, you are quite uninspiring sometimes, <CHARNAME>. Fine, I'll stay quiet, then.~
@562  = ~And I don't know how to answer it. But I suppose...I can think about it. Perhaps when my journey with you comes to an end, I may have my answer.~
@563  = ~That is naivety at its finest. You cannot do those things. People in this world will always be in peril, will always be in trouble.~
@564  = ~I'm sure in your thoughts of idealism it works...but it doesn't, <CHARNAME>. The world is awful, and we just have to deal with it and survive.~
@565  = ~That is bleak, Vienxay. Surely you don't believe that.~
@566  = ~And survive we shall, by working together.~
@567  = ~You're too narrow-minded to see it anyway else, Vienxay, so see it in your bleak fashion as you wish.~
@568  = ~I want to do that, <CHARNAME>. More than anything else. I just wish I knew how.~
@569  = ~It's a process that takes one day at a time.~
@570  = ~I will help you. We can figure it out together.~
@571  = ~I wish I knew, too, Vienxay.~
@572  = ~That is something I would be interested in. There is so much knowledge of our people's history and forgotten elven nations hidden amongst forgotten shadows.~
@573  = ~Being forced from your home helps you see many things in a different light. Keep your  naivety <CHARNAME>, it suits you. But I won't be blinded.~
@574  = ~I don't know why you are nice to me. I must be quite...difficult at times, I admit.~
@575  = ~I'm fond of you Vienxay. And none of us are perfect.~
@576  = ~I think everyone should be treated with some dignity.~
@577  = ~You are very, very difficult.~
@578  = ~I'm fond of you too, <CHARNAME>. You make my time in exile more bearable. Just don't start gloating about it.~
@579  = ~I don't know about everyone. But I do appreciate how you treat me.~
@580  = ~You don't have to agree with me! Hrmph, I should never have said anything.~
@581  = ~Your situation reminds me of my own not long ago, when my mentor betrayed me and I was ousted from Evermeet. I lost everything. But you...have truly, literally lost *everything*.~
@582  = ~Not yet. I am still standing.~
@583  = ~I will get my soul back from Irenicus.~
@584  = ~Why do you care?~
@585  = ~Yes, thanks to... I don't know. You should be dead. I will begrudgingly admit that your power truly surpasses my own.~
@586  = ~And yet Irenicus far surpasses any mage I have ever seen. You could consider taking that you live as a gift and call off this chase.~
@587  = ~I can't, Vienxay. I feel hollow and...unwell. It's not a risk I can take.~
@588  = ~You, Vienxay, are suggesting I do not chase vengeance? Isn't that a little hypocritical from an elf who has pursued revenge before?~
@589  = ~No. Irenicus will pay. He and Bodhi both.~
@590  = ~Irenicus far surpasses any mage I have ever seen. You are still alive now. You could...keep living in the state you are in. Surely it is possible?~
@591  = ~Because I can relate and...I know your pain. But Irenicus far surpasses any mage I have ever known. Not even I can say it is the best interest in continual life to go after him. You should consider calling this pursuit off.~
@592  = ~I only say it because you are a friend, someone with value to me. But if you are insistent, things can't get any worse than as hellish as they are. We were making headway in Spellhold. Perhaps Irenicus can be defeated.~
@593  = ~We won't make headway talking about it. Let's go.~
@594  = ~Thank you, Vienxay. Your friendship helps support me.~
@595  = ~I am insistent. Don't question me on it again.~
@596  = ~If my mentor was like Irenicus, I w- no. I think I would have, even if it was to my death. I suppose I was letting friendship cloud my judgment. If you want the bastard dead and your soul back, let's chase him.~
@597  = ~Good, you are at least certain of the path ahead. Lesser people would balk in fear. If you are insistent on this pursuit, let us find him. With our power together, we can best him or you can die trying.~
@598  = ~Fine, fine, whatever you wish.~
@599  = ~I would hope so. Do you know how hard it is for me to be nice to people? But for you...you are owed the respect.~
@600  = ~My people are not supposed to be here. I can barely see through this darkness as is. Were it not for my skills with shadows, I would be impaired in sight.~
@601  = ~We do not have any other choice, Vienxay.~
@602  = ~Stay strong. We can do this.~
@603  = ~I care about you too much to let you get hurt down here, Vienxay.~
@604  = ~Quiet with your complaints. Let us keep moving.~
@605  = ~Whatever. I suppose it is I who got myself into this situation.~
@606  = ~Hrmph. Fine. Have it your way.~
@607  = ~It is you who I am worried about. I am not the one missing my soul.~
@608  = ~It is you who I am worried about. I am not the one missing my soul. But your concern is...appreciated.~
@609  = ~All sort of my kinds enemies are down here that would be eager to strike me down, and you as well. Touch nothing unless you are certain it is safe, and I will hope our power is enough to see us through.~
@610  = ~Thanks for your unwelcome advice.~
@611  = ~Of course. Let's keep moving.~
@612  = ~You know, there is a chance we might learn something of that tome you were looking for.~
@613  = ~Please, it will keep you alive. But if you wish to be ungrateful, act as you may.~
@614  = ~You remembered? I am surprised, even I have not given it much thought after the sage's words. Yes, there is a chance, but the Underdark is a large place, we would have better luck finding a rabbit in a cornfield.~
@615  = ~Regardless, let us travel carefully. And...thank you for remembering that.~
@616  = ~So not only have you whisked us into the Underdark, but now are are in one of their cities. Why is this a good idea?~
@617  = ~If there was a better option, we wouldn't be here.~
@618  = ~You already know the answer to that, Vienxay.~
@619  = ~I know this makes you uncomfortable. I'm sorry that you have to be here.~
@620  = ~Be quiet. You'll call attention to us.~
@621  = ~Grr. This is so irritating. If we were anywhere else I would...hrmph!~
@622  = ~I can think of many better ideas.~
@623  = ~Like?~
@624  = ~Vienxay, you know that isn't true.~
@625  = ~I am the leader, however, so we are going with my plans.~
@626  = ~...Ugh, I can't think of it on the spot like that. Don't you dare snicker at me.~
@627  = ~You really are something sometimes, Vienxay.~
@628  = ~Well, at least you'll have no problem playing the part of the drow.~
@629  = ~I think we can agree there aren't any better ideas.~
@630  = ~Yes, you are probably so amused. Let us finish our business here quickly. Not even illusion can keep us safe forever.~
@631  = ~Oooh. You make me *so* furious sometimes. Ugh!~
@632  = ~...I will admit I cannot think of anything better. Yet. Hrmph, let us finish our business here quickly. Do not think even an illusion will keep us safe forever.~
@633  = ~I still don't like it. I have no idea why I went along with this so foolishly.~
@634  = ~Ugh, I don't have to be here. I could have ran or left. But I suppose even I am a fool.~
@635  = ~Just promise me that we won't get killed down here. To die in the Underdark as an exile of Evermeet...there could be no lower fate.~
@636  = ~You are stronger than you think, Vienxay. I don't think you'd let that happen to yourself easily.~
@637  = ~Of course not. I promise you'll be safe.~
@638  = ~Keep talking like that and you may get us all caught and killed anyway.~
@639  = ~I am not worried about my own power. But we are in their city. We could be swarmed upon with ease.~
@640  = ~I will stop my protest, as it means nothing now. But be very careful. The drow have their reputation for a reason. Let us not be their next victims.~
@641  = ~You better. To be forgotten and die down here...there is no worse fate for an elf.~
@642  = ~Hrmph, as if I was the one who put us in such a situation. But very well.~
@643  = ~My people...dead, everywhere. What has this man done?~
@644  = ~Vienxay, are you all right?~
@645  = ~Irenicus will stop at nothing to get what he wants.~
@646  = ~We can't stop and stare, Vienxay. We need to keep moving.~
@647  = ~We need to do more than just move. Let us put down this man and make his death very, very painful.~
@648  = ~Of course not. Everywhere, good elven people are dead. This is injustice.~
@649  = ~How could he even be one of us? I...have done things I have regret. But to this scale? It is truly unforgivable.~
@650  = ~Once I was hesitant of chasing this man, after seeing his power. Now I want him dead. Destroyed. Obliterated. We *will* get your soul back. We *will* avenge our people.~
@651  = ~Then let us put your fury to action.~
@652  = ~It's not about vengeance Vienxay, but justice.~
@653  = ~I'm glad you aren't afraid anymore.~
@654  = ~Yes. Time for him to die.~
@655  = ~They are hardly apart now, are they? Vengeance, justice, they are one and the same. The end goal of both is that man's death.~
@656  = ~There is a little fear. He is still incredibly powerful. But my anger erases any hesitation I had. Let us see him buried.~
@657  = ~Do you know much of Shadow magic? I find most either know nothing or have a foolish misunderstanding.~ [X3VLS]
@658  = ~I think you have told me a little of it before.~
@659  = ~That is Shar's weave, isn't it?~
@660  = ~Not much.~
@661  = ~Of course. I use it as well.~
@662  = ~This isn't the time to talk, Vienxay.~
@663  = ~You are not for conversation, it seems. Have it your way.~
@664  = ~Yes, I perhaps have talked of it a little back in our prior travels.~
@665  = ~Well, I know which of the two you fall under, then.~
@666  = ~My people call it Talfirian magic, for it sources from the Talfir, old humans who supposedly combined our own magic with their own technique to it and natural connections to the shadow plane.~
@667  = ~Most practitioners I suppose might descend from the elven texts that still tell about it, or humans who are lucky enough to grasp it.~
@668  = ~So your magic is human tricks, then?~
@669  = ~What happened to the Talfir?~
@670  = ~How did you come to learn it?~
@671  = ~Hrmph. You are trying to mock me. It may have originated from them, but I am the one who is mastering it.~
@672  = ~Disappeared, died off. No one knows, and I certainly don't care. What matters is they left behind a useful contribution in their magic style.~
@673  = ~My mentor taught me, perhaps as a way to get me slowly to convert to Shar's own art. Shadow magic and the Shadow Weave are...close in ways, though Shadow Magic is still of Mystra's own art.~
@674  = ~Many distrust Shadow magic all the same. All they see is darkness and magic of a foreign plane. It is why some civilizations make such rigid laws about magic, such as Amn. They are afraid of power.~
@675  = ~They are just trying to protect people.~
@676  = ~I don't know why Amn is so afraid of magic. It has many boons.~
@677  = ~I do not know about fear. They perhaps just wish to restrict it to the responsible.~
@678  = ~And how well has that gone? You were witness with what happened at the Promenade. Are they really protecting anyone?~
@679  = ~It has many, many boons. And they already have their grim Cowled Wizards to enforce those who would abuse it. But not everyone can be as keen in their structure as elven civilization.~
@680  = ~The "responsible"? More for those with the right connections, or the right amount of money. Societies outside of Evermeet are nothing but unfair to the masses.~
@681  = ~Power rules above all in the realm we live in. The only way to contest power is with power. Even those who complain about power use power in their own way; we call it manipulation. Remember this well, for this is the heart of survival.~
@682  = ~You use it, I have seen. But do you *understand* it?~
@683  = ~I could tell you more, you know. The secrets of shadow magic and why people fear what they do not understand.~ [X3VLS]
@684  = ~What secrets, exactly?~
@685  = ~I'll listen.~
@686  = ~Now isn't a good time.~
@687  = ~I have not touched much on Shadow Magic's link to the shadow plane. When you have achieved an understanding, you can go to an entirely different realm.~
@688  = ~Often the realm is a mirror of our own. If I traveled to the plane, I would likely see a mirror of Amn, perhaps dated, perhaps ahead of its time. Such is the close relationship between the planes.~
@689  = ~Have you ever plane traveled, Vienxay?~
@690  = ~A mirror? So I would see a reflection of where we are now?~
@691  = ~Is there anyway to travel to the shadow plane without shadow magic?~
@692  = ~A few times. It is not always safe to linger. There are all sorts of monstrosities on such a plane that can quickly overwhelm a single traveler, creatures that are as capable with shadow magic as yourself.~
@693  = ~Perhaps. It is not always so predictable what form the place will take in conjunction to where one traveled from.~
@694  = ~Even if you could, it is not necessarily wise. There are all sorts of monstrosities on such a plane that can quickly overwhelm a single traveler, all the easier if they do not know shadow magic or the realm around them.~
@695  = ~Still I have sometimes wondered if I would ever stay there long-term one day. No land replaces my home. This exile grows more and more unbearable by the day. To not see your siblings, your parents...in the plane of shadow time runs differently. It could fade on by quickly.~
@696  = ~By your own words that sounds like a terrible idea.~
@697  = ~Is your present company that bad?~
@698  = ~An exile isn't a vacation, Vienxay.~
@699  = ~I am sorry. This must be hard for you.~
@700  = ~It is a terrible idea. Even if I managed to live, which I know I could, the shadow plane... it changes people when you are there for long periods of time. So would any plane to any foreigner.~
@701  = ~In the comparison to the grand forests of Evermeet, it's sprawling, beautiful cities, being surrounded by only your kind, and the absence of anyone you love...my present company is certainly not as satisfactory.~
@702  = ~I know that. But I wish they had come up with any other punishment.~
@703  = ~Being away from home is cruel. I long for the company I had, not for the company I have now.~
@704  = ~Hey now. Back in Dragonspear, I thought things were...well I thought we had grown close. You sound ungrateful.~
@705  = ~Are we that horrible?~
@706  = ~Well, thanks.~
@707  = ~You do not have to be here, you know.~
@708  = ~I don't know why I veered into this talk. Talking of home only makes me sad and angry. Let's just keep moving.~
@709  = ~What we shared in Dragonspear was a mistake. It was a weakness. And you would do well to forget about it. It is better for all parties.~
@710  = ~There is nowhere else better for me. I would rather be here than the jail I was likely going to be confined to, but I would rather be at Evermeet than here.~
@711  = ~"Now isn't a good time." Hrmph. Fine. We can talk later.~
@712  = ~I begin to find your company quite enjoyable, <CHARNAME>. There are few people who resonate with your strength.~ [X3VLS]
@713  = ~It is nice to see that in one of our people. Especially in someone who is attractive.~
@714  = ~And what about me do you find attractive?~
@715  = ~Weren't you just saying earlier about how you'd rather not even be alongside me?~
@716  = ~Well, don't get your hopes up. I have no interest in you.~
@717  = ~That's nice, but this isn't the time to talk.~
@718  = ~It is nice to see it, even if you are not an elf. Especially in someone who is attractive.~
@719  = ~No interest in chatting at all? Sometimes you are so dull.~
@720  = ~Hungry for a compliment? Your eyes, the form of your face and cheeks, and perhaps your...back has a few interesting features.~
@721  = ~You've ogled my hindquarters?~
@722  = ~I never thought you would be attracted to anyone but yourself.~
@723  = ~You are just as attractive yourself.~
@724  = ~I wish I could say the same, but...~
@725  = ~Things change in time, though your company is not unenjoyable, even if it isn't home.~
@726  = ~Is this your way of apologizing, flirting with me?~
@727  = ~Well, I am glad that you have come around. Adventuring isn't so bad, isn't it?~
@728  = ~I invited you with us because I thought you would be useful. I'm not trying to give you the home you've lost.~
@729  = ~What? I wasn't implying interest. It was just a compliment. Truly. Seriously. Why minds away from Evermeet even think so ahead of themselves is beyond me.~
@730  = ~Just as? I would certainly say quite a bit more than yourself.~
@731  = ~Are you always so vain?~
@732  = ~Well, I can give you that.~
@733  = ~Can't you take a compliment without one-upping yourself?~
@734  = ~Only if it is working. I would think a <PRO_MANWOMAN> would enjoy such words from myself.~
@735  = ~I don't mind. Quite the opposite, even.~
@736  = ~It makes me uncomfortable actually.~
@737  = ~I think I'd need to hear it a bit more to know if it is working or not.~
@738  = ~It isn't so bad? Oh I could get quite into dirty details on why it is far worse than my old life...but it is better than a jail, and better than with other company.~
@739  = ~If you know something of yourself, why not take pride in it? That is how my family was raised. We are beautiful, intelligent, and sophisticated elves of Evermeet. Everything to take pride in.~
@740  = ~Good <PRO_GIRLBOY>. You know when to agree.~
@741  = ~I just wished to correct the statement. But I suppose it has offended you. Very well.~
@742  = ~Then I will certainly make sure you hear more of it.~
@743  = ~Hrmph. Then I won't say such things to you again. And I was beginning to think you would be someone worthy of my interest.~
@744  = ~We have things to do, don't we? Let us get back to the daily slog.~
@745  = ~I suppose what I am trying to get comfortable to say is...sorry. I shouldn't have talked the way I did before.~
@746  = ~You've been good to me, and I hope I can start showing that properly.~
@747  = ~I can think of a few ways you can do that.~
@748  = ~Thank you, Vienxay. I accept your apology.~
@749  = ~You say that. But will you really mean it? Your words didn't feel like a lie.~
@750  = ~It's about time you give me proper respect.~
@751  = ~Forget it, Vienxay. Bother someone else with your forced apology.~
@752  = ~I suppose that is a fair point. I do not mean to make you feel you have to make my accommodations perfect. This is a punishment I serve.~
@753  = ~Do slow down before you get far too excited. The journey is all the fun. But perhaps sometime I may certainly show you my thanks in such a way.~
@754  = ~I do believe we have places to go now, don't we? We can talk more another time.~
@755  = ~They were not entirely, then. But I have had time to reflect. In a way, my predicament could be so much worse, and I am able to see a world I would have never dared venture out to see.~
@756  = ~It is not home, it never will be. But it is an experience I should admittedly try to enjoy the most out of.~
@757  = ~Yes, yes. As I have said many times, I do owe you much. I should perhaps whine less and appreciate that more.~
@758  = ~Then fine. I won't bother you further if that is what you desire.~
@759  = ~And more.~
@760  = ~Just because I am the most beautiful person I know, doesn't mean there are others that are worthy of admiration.~
@761  = ~I wished to chat about something, if you have a moment. About our journey.~ [X3VLS]
@762  = ~What did you want to talk about?~
@763  = ~Go on. Speak.~
@764  = ~This isn't a good time.~
@765  = ~You have given our...patron, so to speak, a large amount of gold. But do you not think we are being manipulated?~
@766  = ~It was that or working with vampires. It would have turned out worse if we chose Bodhi.~
@767  = ~Maybe. But it has gotten us this far.~
@768  = ~Bodhi provided the best opportunity. Maybe we are being pulled, but if it gets us to Irenicus, so be it.~
@769  = ~This is the only way to get to Irenicus. If there was anything else, I would have done it.~
@770  = ~I...I just wished to see if you were okay. That is all.~
@771  = ~What do you think, Vienxay?~
@772  = ~I am alive, aren't I? That is all that matters.~
@773  = ~I'd rather not talk about this.~
@774  = ~You are trying to gather a large amount of gold for a patron who may not in the end help you. Aren't you worried about being manipulated?~
@775  = ~There isn't any other choice, Vienxay. You know this.~
@776  = ~If they lie, the pay the price.~
@777  = ~This is the only way to find Imoen.~
@778  = ~I'll not likely find Irenicus without their help.~
@779  = ~I suppose I shouldn't have asked that way.~
@780  = ~Sometimes. Sometimes that is not enough.~
@781  = ~If that is what you wish to believe.~
@782  = ~And yet the enemy you chase doesn't get any closer if you do.~
@783  = ~I do not mean to be overly critical. I am just reminded of my mentor. You seem pulled into this path, but I am unsure how much of it is truly your choosing.~
@784  = ~You seem strong, yet this makes me question your power. Do you understand what true power is, <CHARNAME>?~
@785  = ~I do not care about power, Vienxay.~
@786  = ~It means being able to be uncontested.~
@787  = ~It means being able to dominate others.~
@788  = ~What do you think true power is?~
@789  = ~So many say this. So few *mean* it.~
@790  = ~Perhaps. Though the test of one's power is always to challenge someone with more of it.~
@791  = ~Hrmph. In a way, yes. Predator finds prey to cement their reputation and legacy. Such is one way to display power.~
@792  = ~True power is sought by oneself, and not given to them. True power always becomes stronger. The mage forever learning new magic, the warrior ever keeping ahead in their tactical genius.~
@793  = ~True power is being able to choose your own path and carve it, damn anyone else's thoughts or actions. That is true power.~
@794  = ~But what about helping others? Is that not the responsible of the powerful?~
@795  = ~I see. I don't know if I agree with your beliefs, Vienxay, but it is enlightening.~
@796  = ~I think I see what you mean. True power is to be sought and respected.~
@797  = ~By helping the weak you leave them unenlightened. How can they become stronger or smarter if you hand hold them through every hardship? Such trials of life filter out the meaningless to the legacies that will carry on.~
@798  = ~I hope it will be more then that to you. I mean it when I say that you seem...almost pulled in the direction you are.~
@799  = ~I am glad that you are beginning to see it my way.~
@800  = ~Seek the end of this man, <CHARNAME> if you will, <CHARNAME>, if you insist, as foolhardy as it is to track down a powerful mage. But then live free. Live by your own will, your own volition, your own power. Do not let him be the one to drag and decide how you should react to what he has just done to you.~
@801  = ~Irenicus doesn't define my life, Vienxay.~
@802  = ~I will, Vienxay, and nothing less.~
@803  = ~I don't want to. But he has forced my hand.~
@804  = ~And that is a testament to his power, and how yours has so much more to grow.~
@805  = ~Perhaps you may feel it. But everything you have done ultimately is to be closer to confronting him again, is it not? And that is a true testament of his power, for they draw everyone else to them like honey. Know this, and be wary, and then you may become stronger for it.~
@806  = ~Good. Perhaps my forced time in these human lands may at least do you some good, even if I am unhappy in them.~
@807  = ~Then I will remain silent on the matter.~
@808  = ~I have another question I wish to ask of you.~ [X3VLS]
@809  = ~Another one, then? What do you wish to know?~
@810  = ~Ever curious about me, are you?~
@811  = ~Not now, Vienxay.~
@812  = ~You are a curious person. Far more unique than most people outside of Evermeet.~
@813  = ~The way you act towards others, I have noted, borders on malice. While I respect acting for one's self interest, being overtly malicious does little good for anyone.~
@814  = ~Really? I thought you of all people would approve of it.~
@815  = ~I do what I like. If I want your opinion, I will ask for it.~
@816  = ~I may have gotten carried away. I will try to be better.~
@817  = ~When deserved. Otherwise, it gets you into trouble with the law. I have been in trouble with such far too often now.~
@818  = ~I do not wish to discourage. I only wish to suggest you are less...overt when you do so.~
@819  = ~I see. I will take your advice.~
@820  = ~Why? I think I am doing fine just as is.~
@821  = ~I will consider it. I promise nothing.~
@822  = ~I am not asking that you reform yourself. What you are doing is not necessarily wrong. Showing your power gives a message to others.~
@823  = ~I am only suggesting that you are more subtle when you do it. The less trouble we get with guards, the better.~
@824  = ~You are ever the soul of reason, listening to an elf such as myself. Come then, let us carry on. That is all I wished to say.~
@825  = ~So be it. I have said my piece and that is all I wanted. Let us carry on.~
@826  = ~You seem to steer a course that focuses on your own wants. If something is mutually beneficial, you partake, if it is not. You move on. Is that correct?~
@827  = ~I try to help others more then myself, to be honest.~
@828  = ~Yes. I need to focus on myself if I am going to survive.~
@829  = ~I could care less about others.~
@830  = ~That is disappointing, if it is true. I had thought you a soul of reason.~
@831  = ~And with everything that I have observed going on with you, that is the best belief that will suit you.~
@832  = ~That is often true with myself. If you are not apathetic enough, you grow concerned over every little thing.~
@833  = ~Wow. You are definitely ever the shrew, Vienxay.~
@834  = ~Aasimar, you of all people are not welcome to throw your opinion into this conversation. What does your celestial bloodline care? They are obsessed only with fighting demons and devils and serving their god. They could not be more simple.~
@835  = ~I say this because I do not wish for you to be distracted. I have seen how awful life is in Amn. You cannot help everyone. They must learn to stand up for themselves.~
@836  = ~If they pay, then I do not mind offering my service.~
@837  = ~I won't. I am focused on my goals alone. Anyone who gets aid is only because they help further these goals.~
@838  = ~I will try to help who I can. Amn can be better for it, even if you do not like it.~
@839  = ~I suppose that is a fair argument. I have nothing more to say. I have said what I wished.~
@840  = ~Good. I have nothing to add. You seem to be wise and reasonable, and I am content with my curiosity.~
@841  = ~You are a fool for it. I've nothing more to add, this conversation has been disappointing, but sated my curiosity.~
@842  = ~Then fine. I will say nothing of it. Do as you wish, I only ask you be more subtle so you do not attract a contingent of guards.~
@843  = ~I have seen how charitable you are to others. Do you not understand that you only spread weakness? That they will continue to be helpless in the face of further peril, always expecting a hand?~
@844  = ~What is the alternative? Continue to let them suffer from lack of aid?~
@845  = ~Helping them helps me with my own goals. It is the only reason I do this.~
@846  = ~Did I not help you, Vienxay? You would be in prison without me.~
@847  = ~They will not continue to suffer. They will learn how to stand or they will die because they were not capable of surviving the trials of life.~
@848  = ~I see. If that is the truth, then I understand you more, though it has not seemed that way.~
@849  = ~Perhaps. I am a Shadowmage, if you do not remember. If worst came to worst, I would have escaped to the Shadow Plane. But I admit, I would always be on the run in Amn. Not a desirable condition. Still, part of me regrets your help. It was a moment of...weakness.~
@850  = ~Hrmph. As you wish.~
@851  = ~You are quite renown from Baldur's Gate. In the time since, surely you have had some lovers, as suits you?~ [X3VLS]
@852  = ~I might have. Why?~
@853  = ~You were with me at the beginning of my travels, Vienxay. You would know the answer to this.~
@854  = ~I've not really had the time for that, Vienxay.~
@855  = ~What makes you bring this up?~
@856  = ~I am merely curious of your experience.~
@857  = ~I only remember my time with you.~
@858  = ~Oh I am *plenty* experienced.~
@859  = ~That's private.~
@860  = ~Really? Somehow I think you are exaggerating.~
@861  = ~That was...we were not lovers. It was just a moment. Though an enjoyable one.~
@862  = ~Foreigners are so prudish on these things, I have found. Hrmph.~
@863  = ~I suppose I would, if it is as you suggest.~
@864  = ~Oh really?~
@865  = ~What of Emily? That girl looks upon you as if she has never seen a man. A bit disturbing. You are not into her, are you?~
@866  = ~I like Emily a lot, actually.~
@867  = ~No, she is not my type.~
@868  = ~Why, are you jealous?~
@869  = ~Jealous? Of a mutt? You must be joking.~
@870  = ~I do however, do not want to deal with her glares if our...bond with each other escalates. So, what is she to you?~
@871  = ~I am sorry Vienxay, but I like Emily a lot.~
@872  = ~She is just a friend, Vienxay. Fear not.~
@873  = ~Then...ugh, I am glad we have discussed this. You have terrible taste...but I am glad I know this now before things escalated.~
@874  = ~Good. You have fine taste after all.~
@875  = ~Let us carry on. I find I no longer have the desire for conversation.~
@876  = ~I have seen you spend time with that halfling. You do know half of his stories are made up, merely trying to impress? His intent is obvious.~
@877  = ~You do have better taste than Kale, I imagine. There are far more beautiful people out there worthy of your attention.~
@878  = ~I care for Kale, Vienxay. I hope you understand.~
@879  = ~You are quite right, Vienxay. There isn't anything between me and Kale.~
@880  = ~What is wrong with liking you both?~
@881  = ~I am not going to compete with him. I should not have to compete with him. If things escalate, someone's heart will be broken, and I will not share.~
@882  = ~If that is how it is, then I am sorry. I prefer Kale.~
@883  = ~Fear not. I'm interested in seeing how things go with us.~
@884  = ~Hrmph. I do not quite understand...but each has their preferences, however *odd* that they are.~
@885  = ~Good choice.~
@886  = ~What of the bard, Recorder? She seems obsessed with you, concerning so. Writing and writing about you. She looks up to you like you are on a pedestal.~
@887  = ~You should stop giving her ideas. Easier to disappoint her now.~
@888  = ~I'm very fond of Recorder, Vienxay. I want to see how things go between us.~
@889  = ~She's just my recorder to me, nothing more.~
@890  = ~What are you talking about?~
@891  = ~I am saying she is clearly wanting your attention, and your affections. It is almost sickeningly desperate.~
@892  = ~You may find it amusing, but I don't. Stop indulging her.~
@893  = ~An incredibly disappointing response. But do as you wish.~
@894  = ~Then I may hint to her it is as such. I'm sure she'll get the message clearer from me. Plus it will save you a bit of pain.~
@895  = ~I suppose I brought this up to begin with because I remember such times when I had my admirers and those interested in intimacy with myself.~
@896  = ~I had wealth to purchase what I desired, to pursue what knowledge I desired, the prestige to garner the attention I wanted from all save the royalty.~
@897  = ~But you have never really known such luxury. Given your accomplishments, it is a shame.~
@898  = ~There are just better things than luxury and hedonistic pursuits, Vienxay.~
@899  = ~I hope to have that one day.~
@900  = ~I've been on the road for so long. There hasn't been an opportunity to relax very often.~
@901  = ~Such is the pinnacle of life. You know you have achieved much when you are able to indulge in whatever pleasures you desire with little effort.~
@902  = ~But I suppose that can be dull. The chase is half of the fun.~
@903  = ~If you continue to take care of yourself and treat them well, I can think of someone who would certainly give you the chance.~
@904  = ~Well, I will continue doing what I am then, in the hopes that I get that opportunity with "someone".~
@905  = ~We will see. The future is not always certain.~
@906  = ~I'm flattered, but I'm not interested.~
@907  = ~With you? Not a chance.~
@908  = ~We will just have to see about that, won't we?~
@909  = ~You are quite serious, aren't you? You will find the future is more certain when you take control of it. But as you wish.~
@910  = ~Disappointing. Something I think, you will even regret.~
@911  = ~It would be about that time in Evermeet. The Secrets of the Heart.~ [X3VLS]
@912  = ~The Secrets of the Heart?~
@913  = ~You are reminiscing about Evermeet again? You must miss home deeply.~
@914  = ~Stay focused Vienxay. This isn't the time to muse.~
@915  = ~The Secrets of the Heart was a festival to revel when the moon was highest. To engage in one's lust with a lover, show off their art, or pledge themselves to their passions.~
@916  = ~It was one of Hanali's festivals, our goddess of love and beauty.~
@917  = ~I thought that was Sune?~
@918  = ~And did you partake in this festival?~
@919  = ~It sounds like a good time.~
@920  = ~Hrmph. Sune is one of the human gods. Mystra is the only goddess I would pray to outside of the Seldarine.~
@921  = ~I enjoyed myself quite much in past Secrets of the Heart. I have brought a couple of lovers to them, those who I felt closest to.~
@922  = ~With all your talk of power and how helping others is a weakness, you don't seem like the lover type.~
@923  = ~Tell me about them.~
@924  = ~Only a couple? I am surprised.~
@925  = ~I have had many, many dalliances in my life, but only a couple have truly moved my heart.~
@926  = ~I engage in it for the passion, for the enjoyment of being pursued and doing a little chasing in return. But sometimes one does fall into love's trap and becomes weaker for it.~
@927  = ~There was Erian'na, the first I brought, a friend who I was close with. She had asked me and I did not see she had romantic intentions.~
@928  = ~I indulged her pursuit for the day, perhaps out of curiosity to see if I would feel the same, but ultimately I found I did not feel the same way, and ended things with her. She wanted permanency, but I did not.~
@929  = ~I didn't know you had an interest in another female.~
@930  = ~Who was the other?~
@931  = ~You broke her heart? Poor Erian'na.~
@932  = ~I have a slight preference in men. But I have been with my own sex before. Above all I simply enjoy pursuing and being pursued, that delights me above all other details.~
@933  = ~Have no pity. I at least gave her a good time. Little heartbreaks are painful, but she will have the sweet memories.~
@934  = ~The other was my last real lover, Leondolis. With him I truly felt the weakness of love. I think had I never met my mentor, I may have even married him.~
@935  = ~Alas, I was foolish and got seduced by shadow magic and her gradual introduction of Shar's weave alike. And you know well how that ended.~
@936  = ~In an accident, I killed him, and have been exiled ever since.~
@937  = ~Do you regret murdering him?~
@938  = ~Love isn't a weakness, Vienxay. You can draw comfort from it.~
@939  = ~You are lucky they didn't do worse.~
@940  = ~Every day.~
@941  = ~So you think. But it makes you...dependent. You begin to rely on someone else, begin to think for someone else. You lose focus on your own pursuits and become vulnerable for it. But still, I will admit I loved him deeply.~
@942  = ~They would not have done worse. My people frown upon taking the life of another elf, no matter the crime. This is true for most elven civilizations, even outside of Evermeet.~
@943  = ~I miss most his ability to really ease my urges. They have grown quite considerable.~
@944  = ~You really do share too much sometimes, Vienxay.~
@945  = ~Well, if you ever need help with that...~
@946  = ~Er...right.~
@947  = ~And as I have said many times in the past, the rest of the realms are so prudish. But enough of that. We should get back to the journey.~
@948  = ~Bold. I may actually consider it sometime. But not now.~
@949  = ~But never mind this. We ought to be getting back to our business.~
@950  = ~More than you know.~
@951  = ~Fine. We can talk later.~
@952  = ~We are resting now, then? I suppose it is the right time.~ [X3VLS]
@953  = ~Yes. Did you want something?~
@954  = ~We have been traveling without rest for a while.~
@955  = ~We could use time to tend to ourselves.~
@956  = ~I'm too tired to talk, Vienxay. Good <DAYNIGHT>~
@957  = ~Oh very well. See you when you awaken.~
@958  = ~A nagging injury? Perhaps you will allow me to assist?~
@959  = ~You aren't a healer, Vienxay.~
@960  = ~Well I wouldn't mind the hand.~
@961  = ~No thank you, Vienxay. I cam manage on my own.~
@962  = ~I was going to ask if you wished to join me when we rest. It is a bit cold and it would be nice to have a body nearby.~
@963  = ~Er, you just want someone to keep you warm?~
@964  = ~Are you asking what I think you are asking?~
@965  = ~I'd rather stay in my own tent.~
@966  = ~To start. There are of course, certain "necessary" techniques to get us to be warm.~
@967  = ~Isn't this a little fast, Vienxay?~
@968  = ~Well, I can't say no to that.~
@969  = ~Whoa, whoa, slow down Vienxay. I am not interested.~
@970  = ~I am told I give wonderful massages with my hands that will really relax you.~
@971  = ~It certainly doesn't have to stop there. There are all sorts of things we can do to release built up tension.~
@972  = ~Are you asking to sleep with me?~
@973  = ~Er, isn't this a little fast?~
@974  = ~I would rather be alone.~
@975  = ~Well, you don't make it fun when you say it outright. But what do you say? My urges are considerable, and you are very attractive.~
@976  = ~I say yes.~
@977  = ~This is too fast for me, Vienxay. I like you, but I don't think we are there yet.~
@978  = ~I'm not interested in doing that with you, Vienxay.~
@979  = ~A little, perhaps, but it is just a bit of fun. Nothing serious. We make each other at ease and then go on with things. What is the harm?~
@980  = ~Well, if that is the case, let's have some fun.~
@981  = ~I would rather it mean something, Vienxay. To be between two lovers.~
@982  = ~Sorry, I'm just not interested.~
@983  = ~Excellent. I think you will find my talents make your sleep one to remember.~
@984  = ~I see. You are like Leondis and Erian'na, they too, wanted things to *mean* something. But that just makes things complicated.~
@985  = ~All the better that we sleep apart, then. I am getting confused and it is frustrating me.~
@986  = ~What? I have been denied? No one denies me I...ugh! Forget it. Rest on your own, then.~
@987  = ~I see you are awake.~ [X3VLS]
@988  = ~No one has ever refused my advances. Is it because I am ugly? Do you hate me?~
@989  = ~You are beautiful, Vienxay, and I don't hate you. I just want to take things slow.~
@990  = ~I've just woken up, have you been thinking about this all night?~
@991  = ~I won't deny you are beautiful, Vienxay. But I don't like you.~
@992  = ~You're not as pretty as you think you are, you know.~
@993  = ~I don't entirely understand. Are you after something meaningful, a relationship?~
@994  = ~Yes. That is what I want.~
@995  = ~Ah, now you get it.~
@996  = ~Well now that you put it that way, no. I don't think I want anything from you.~
@997  = ~It has been bothering me. The people who I choose to pursue never say no to my charms. Why did you?~
@998  = ~I see. Then I will stop wasting our time for the both of us.~
@999  = ~I...do not know if I can give you that, if I should give you that.~
@1000 = ~So you dislike me then? Is that it?~
@1001 = ~No, I do like you. But you can be a bit vain.~
@1002 = ~Not everything is judged simply by looks, Vienxay.~
@1003 = ~I don't like you, at least not in that way.~
@1004 = ~You are an elf, and so I would not be averse to it. But I am an *exile*. Beyond a bit of fun, to be involved with me...it would bring you down.~
@1005 = ~What? But you tout yourself as the greatest person ever, more or less.~
@1006 = ~Vienxay, you couldn't do that. I am a child of Bhaal, you know.~
@1007 = ~If you don't want that, then we shouldn't continue whatever this is.~
@1008 = ~But I am not.~
@1009 = ~In some ways, that only adds to your prestige.~
@1010 = ~You are better than me, <CHARNAME>. You are better than me, and I hate it, and that is why I do not know if it is right to give you what you want.~
@1011 = ~The others are rising. This isn't the time to talk more about this.~
@1012 = ~You are not an elf, <CHARNAME>. You would not live as long as I, nor is it proper. I have no interest in producing half-breeds, I have taught how abhorrent such a thing is.~
@1013 = ~Even...if part of me is not averse to it, it would only hurt you. It would only hurt us.~
@1014 = ~That is what I want, Vienxay. Damn the consequences.~
@1015 = ~This is bigger than just race, Vienxay. If two people care about each other, that is the only thing that should matter.~
@1016 = ~If that is what you want, then we shouldn't continue whatever this is.~
@1017 = ~Your words move me. It is very tempting to give you what you want but...~
@1018 = ~And yet everything I have been taught says otherwise. Even if...a small part of me wishes it was different. That it was okay.~
@1019 = ~I trust that you were satisfied?~
@1020 = ~Quite. You are more than just beautiful, it seems.~
@1021 = ~It was lovely, Vienxay. Does this mean we are together?~
@1022 = ~It was what I needed, though I don't think we should do this again.~
@1023 = ~Is that a compliment? You could do better.~
@1024 = ~We should get ready, before the others start to stir.~
@1025 = ~But they haven't stirred yet. Perhaps one more round?~
@1026 = ~Why not snuggle against me for a while? We still have a few minutes.~
@1027 = ~Ah, good idea. Let's get to it.~
@1028 = ~Gods no. I don't want the others gossiping and getting crazy ideas. But perhaps if wake earlier next time, you can get such a second indulgence.~
@1029 = ~We should get ready. We have many things to do, I imagine.~
@1030 = ~There is no hurry. One more round can't hurt.~
@1031 = ~Why not snuggle against me for a while? We can take our time.~
@1032 = ~You are insatiable. But I don't have any complaints.~
@1033 = ~This was enjoyable. We should...indulge ourselves again sometime.~
@1034 = ~That is what people in a relationship do. This was just...a dalliance.~
@1035 = ~And what if I didn't want that?~
@1036 = ~Oh. I see. Never mind, then.~
@1037 = ~I don't want to be someone who just pleases your silly urges. If that's all your after, you can find someone else.~
@1038 = ~What? Why is that?~
@1039 = ~I want a proper relationship, Vienxay. It was nice, but maybe it was too soon.~
@1040 = ~It wasn't that great of an experience.~
@1041 = ~I had you and that is all I wanted.~
@1042 = ~I see. Usually it is I who throw people away. I suppose now I know what it feels like.~
@1043 = ~What? You...ugh. I am not interested in continuing this either, then.~
@1044 = ~I should confess something to you. Something that I have been trying with my magic.~
@1045 = ~You haven't been casting a spell on me, have you?~
@1046 = ~What is it?~
@1047 = ~Don't worry about it. This isn't the time to talk.~
@1048 = ~Then I won't worry about it. Lead on.~
@1049 = ~Not precisely. Not all spells require casting on a person, after all.~
@1050 = ~I have been trying to improve my divination, and have been sort of using you to practice. A sort of spell to help divine your "aura", so to speak, and understand more of yourself.~
@1051 = ~That is not disturbing at all.~
@1052 = ~And what are you seeing with your spell?~
@1053 = ~Please do not do that anymore without my consent.~
@1054 = ~Hrmph. As you wish, though you should still hear what I saw.~
@1055 = ~Magic learned must be practiced, and the world at large is suitable practice for divination. It's not like I am dominating your mind. There are far worse things.~
@1056 = ~In merchants, I saw the aura of the craftsmen and laborer, earth. In priests I often see the aura of the healer, bright white that is life. But in you I see only darkness and death.~
@1057 = ~Are you saying that I am going to die?~
@1058 = ~That is ominous. What does that mean?~
@1059 = ~That's nonsense. Do you really believe in this magic?~
@1060 = ~It could mean that, though I think otherwise.~
@1061 = ~Of course I do. Magic is real, it can be felt, it can be thrown, and it can predict. To think otherwise is to be foolish.~
@1062 = ~I believe it means that you will be facing a lot of violent troubles ahead, and there are many changes for you to die.~
@1063 = ~I am not a proper seer, and I could be wrong. It is troubling however. In Evermeet we have never faced death on such a scale except for the rare, rare invasion. But your entire path forward seems full of it.~
@1064 = ~I am fine with that. Whatever is thrown at me, I will triumph.~
@1065 = ~It is a bit discomforting. Is there anything I can do to change it?~
@1066 = ~I don't really believe in this. I will make my own path.~
@1067 = ~A good attitude to have. And I will ensure that you will triumph, for your sake and mine.~
@1068 = ~I fear the path you have to walk is laid out before you. I have always felt you have little control of your destiny. My little bout of magic seems only to confirm it more.~
@1069 = ~But fear not, I will see that you triumph, for your sake and mine.~
@1070 = ~If you can, that is what you should do. But I do not think you have that liberty yet.~
@1071 = ~You have cut it close on some of our last battles. Can you be a little bit less careless? You don't have to look out for me at the expense of yourself.~
@1072 = ~I am trying to protect you, Vienxay. Keeping you and the others alive is important to me.~
@1073 = ~It is not my fault. Sometimes the enemy is clever and the plan has to be adjusted.~
@1074 = ~I don't want to listen to this critique, Vienxay. Be silent.~
@1075 = ~Fine. I will be silent, then.~
@1076 = ~That doesn't mean you have to be concerned of me so much. I can handle myself.~
@1077 = ~Why are you so ungrateful?~
@1078 = ~If you are going to be a shrew, then just leave me alone.~
@1079 = ~Fine, then I will leave you be.~
@1080 = ~It is just...it is causing me to think of things. To feel things. To want to do things that I shouldn't.~
@1081 = ~What things exactly, and what is wrong with that?~
@1082 = ~Then let yourself. Why hide it?~
@1083 = ~And I really don't care about any of that. Just stop criticizing me and stop bothering me.~
@1084 = ~Because it makes me *weak*. I am supposed to be strong. Not...Not desiring some <PRO_RACE> in ways that are not merely physical.~
@1085 = ~Just tell me that you do not feel this way about me. Tell that you want things to be simple.~
@1086 = ~I can't lie to you, Vienxay. I care about you a lot.~
@1087 = ~Even if I said what you wanted, I could not act any differently.~
@1088 = ~Of course I don't. I'm just protecting a friend.~
@1089 = ~You are a *fool*!~
@1090 = ~(Suddenly, she grabs your face and pulls you into a brief, rough kiss.)~
@1091 = ~(Return her affections.)~
@1092 = ~Er, Vienxay?!~
@1093 = ~(Push her away). This isn't right. You were right, we shouldn't be doing this.~
@1094 = ~I am a fool too. I shouldn't have done that...I am embarrassed and...feeling even more confused.~
@1095 = ~We can figure it out together.~
@1096 = ~Do not feel embarrassed. This is normal. This is *good*.~
@1097 = ~I can't handle someone who can't figure things out. We shouldn't do this.~
@1098 = ~I...see. Well that is what I wanted to hear. I suppose my foolish predicament can come to an end then. Thank you.~
@1099 = ~Give me time to think. That is what I ask, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps it is just the stress of our journey making myself act...odd.~
@1100 = ~I...whatever! I should have never listened to my heart! Let us never speak of this again.~
@1101 = ~Tell me something, <CHARNAME>, and tell me nothing but the truth.~
@1102 = ~Are there others in our party who interest you? I will not share their attentions. It is me or them. I do not share. I do not want to share. Tell me now so we can get this annoyance over.~
@1103 = ~There isn't anyone else, Vienxay, fret not.~
@1104 = ~Then I won't waste your time. I have strong feelings for Aerie.~
@1105 = ~Then I'm going to admit something...odd, but I care for Jaheria as more than just my guardian.~
@1106 = ~I will tell you the truth then. I care very much for Anomen.~
@1107 = ~Viconia has ensnared my heart.~
@1108 = ~I have grown close with Rasaad. I think he is good for me.~
@1109 = ~It's odd, but I feel close with Hexxat.~
@1110 = ~It's a little wild, but I'm beginning to see myself with Neera.~
@1111 = ~I'm beginning to fall for Sirene. I hope you understand.~
@1112 = ~I find Petsy charming. I think she is right for me.~
@1113 = ~It was all strange at first, but I think I am in love with Yvette.~
@1114 = ~I find myself deeply attracted to Dorn.~
@1115 = ~I'm not interested in starting a relationship with anyone, nor talking about it.~
@1116 = ~I'd rather be friends with you, Vienxay.~
@1117 = ~Disappointing. Well then I see we have nothing more to discuss. Your answer gives me everything I was seeking.~
@1118 = ~The drow. Perhaps whatever I saw in you I was merely imagining. My interest has definitely waned.~
@1119 = ~You are choosing a half-blood over me? How irksome. You clearly are not someone I know, then. Hrmph.~
@1120 = ~You are fawning over a woman. From a mere portrait? You are mad. Clearly I must be having bad taste. I'll rectify that immediately.~
@1121 = ~You pick the devil over myself? You truly are a fool. I clearly was wrong about you.~
@1122 = ~Good. I would have it no other way.~
@1123 = ~I know you are...tired, <CHARNAME>. But I thought to speak with you.~
@1124 = ~Are you wanting to join me again?~
@1125 = ~I thought you wanted some time.~
@1126 = ~Not now, Vienxay. I'm too tired to deal with whatever you want to talk about.~
@1127 = ~Then I will stop bothering you with anything. Hrmph.~
@1128 = ~No, I think that is the problem.~
@1129 = ~I did, and I think I have had the time I needed.~
@1130 = ~I regret my earlier advances to you. They have just complicated things, most likely during a time when you do not need complications.~
@1131 = ~I have told you how such feelings are weakness. I do not want to weaken you at a time where you need strength.~
@1132 = ~I don't have any regrets. And neither should you.~
@1133 = ~I've told you before, Vienxay. I am not afraid. My strength comes from others, from you.~
@1134 = ~Maybe you are right.~
@1135 = ~Then...if you are not afraid, if you wish to damn all the risks, I would like to be with you.~
@1136 = ~As long as you are okay with being with someone who isn't an elf.~
@1137 = ~I would like that, Vienxay. That is what I would want.~
@1138 = ~No, you were right before. I should be focused.~
@1139 = ~It is not an easy choice, but I think it is the best choice. There is much you are going to face in the path ahead, I am certain of that. It is better to do that without distractions.~
@1140 = ~I am. Evermeet is beyond my reach. I want to learn to tolerate the people here more. To be okay with getting close to other kinds of people. To you.~
@1141 = ~(She presses close to you, before moving her lips to yours. Soft. Yearning.)~
@1142 = ~Perhaps we should continue this somewhere more alone?~
@1143 = ~Let's, shall we?~
@1144 = ~Maybe we can just start with holding each other? Let's take this slow.~
@1145 = ~I am a bit tired. Maybe another time.~
@1146 = ~Then come with me. Let us join together properly this time.~
@1147 = ~That...is suitable. As long as I am close to you, this is a satisfactory compromise.~
@1148 = ~Then we can another time. I will just rest next to you. As long as I am close to you, I will be satisfied.~
@1149 = ~Good morning, <CHARNAME>. Some food before we hit the road?~
@1150 = ~What is that smell? And what is this?~
@1151 = ~Sure, I am starved.~
@1152 = ~Did you cook this?~
@1153 = ~No, we should get moving as soon as we can.~
@1154 = ~This is a classic breakfast cuisine from Evermeet. Crushed strawberries on bread glazed with maple sugar. Simple and sweet.~
@1155 = ~Hrmph, you make excellent food go to waste, my love. But as you wish. Something for me to snack on later.~
@1156 = ~Of course I did. No one else can make food that I like.~
@1157 = ~I suppose I will admit however, that the dwarf priestess does do a decent job.~
@1158 = ~Here, take a bite. What do you think?~
@1159 = ~Delicious, but don't let me have it all. Here, let me feed you a bite.~
@1160 = ~What is the occasion?~
@1161 = ~Er it's...good. Really.~
@1162 = ~I don't think I can stomach this.~
@1163 = ~What? What's wrong with it? Let me have a bite...~
@1164 = ~I want to show you affection in more ways than just my body, <CHARNAME>. Getting you a good start I thought would be one way to achieve this.~
@1165 = ~As long as still get some intimate time with you.~
@1166 = ~I like this side of you, Vienxay. I hope to see more of it.~
@1167 = ~We should get moving, no?~
@1168 = ~You will, <CHARNAME>. That I promise.~
@1169 = ~Of course you will. A few times with you is just not enough, is it?~
@1170 = ~I suppose we should, yes.~
@1171 = ~Come <CHARNAME>, let us face the world together, <CHARNAME>.~
@1172 = ~You don't sound convinced. Let me see how it tastes.~
@1173 = ~Ugh, this is way too sweet! I ruined it! How infuriating.~
@1174 = ~I've never been treated by you like this. I'm just happy with your attempt.~
@1175 = ~Don't be disappointed, I thought it tasted fine.~
@1176 = ~Maybe you shouldn't cook anymore.~
@1177 = ~Either you have a sweet soul or you have bad taste then.~
@1178 = ~Hrmph, don't think one failed attempt is going to dissuade me.~
@1179 = ~<CHARNAME>...what are you now?~
@1180 = ~I'm me, Vienxay. What else would I be?~
@1181 = ~I don't want to talk about this.~
@1182 = ~You want to ignore the obvious problem, then?~
@1183 = ~You transformed into...that creature. You don't even have a soul anymore.~
@1184 = ~You are lucky to be even alive.~
@1185 = ~I will get my soul back from Irenicus, Vienxay. Do not worry.~
@1186 = ~Are you afraid of me?~
@1187 = ~It was a harrowing experience. I'm still not sure how I am here.~
@1188 = ~I do worry, <CHARNAME>. What happened to you, what I saw, was nothing sort of horrific.~
@1189 = ~That mage kills people effortlessly. He took your soul. Whatever he is going to do next, it is not something we want to get in his way.~
@1190 = ~Please. You are alive still. We can stop this chase and just live as things are.~
@1191 = ~I can't, Vienxay. I don't know if I will live if I don't. I have to go after him.~
@1192 = ~This isn't like you at all. You are all about revenge and power.~
@1193 = ~What is wrong with you? Snap out of whatever is overcoming you.~
@1194 = ~*Sigh*. I think it is foolish. Think it over carefully.~
@1195 = ~There is *nothing* overcoming me. I am trying to advise you for your own sake!~
@1196 = ~He is even worse than my former mentor. More manipulative, more cunning, doing things with magic I could probably never dream of. Are you sure you really want to go after such a man?~
@1197 = ~You have told me many times about seizing my own path. I *want* to stop Irenicus. I *will* get him.~
@1198 = ~We have our own strength too, Vienxay. I know we can beat him. We just cannot let fear stop us.~
@1199 = ~Even if you were right, and I do nothing, I may *still* die. I don't know what will happen if I just let him go.~
@1200 = ~You don't have to stop him with me. You've done more than enough to repay me helping you.~
@1201 = ~Ugh. I see there is no convincing you. You make a good argument, though I may still try to change your mind.~
@1202 = ~I don't, but I also have no where else to go or be. I'm staying. I told you I would be with you, that is even through the foolish, though I may still try to change your mind.~
@1203 = ~Just please limit the foolish, crazy decision-making you do after this man dies. I can only handle so much craziness in my life.~
@1204 = ~I have always supported acts of revenge, yes. But this may be futile.~
@1205 = ~I am not afraid of you. I am afraid for you.~
@1206 = ~<CHARNAME>. Let me start by saying I care about you very, very much.~
@1207 = ~But why. Are. We. In the Underdark?!~
@1208 = ~Vienxay, not so loud.~
@1209 = ~You know as well as I do this is the only path we can take.~
@1210 = ~Not now, Vienxay. Quiet down. We have no idea what we will face down here.~
@1211 = ~Hrmph. "Quiet down", <PRO_HESHE> says. Don't expect me to be sweet later.~
@1212 = ~Traveling through the Shadowplane back to Amn sounds plenty better.~
@1213 = ~You can do that?~
@1214 = ~If you can't handle this Vienxay, why not just go?~
@1215 = ~As desirable as an easier route would be, this is what we have to work with.~
@1216 = ~No...only for myself. And I do not want to know what this is like in the shadow realm. Probably more horrifying.~
@1217 = ~The only way I could go is through the Shadowplane. And I do not know if the shadow realm's version of the Underdark is safer. It may be quite worse.~
@1218 = ~Ignore me. I am just...my people do not belong here. An elf does not belong here.~
@1219 = ~(Squeeze her hand.)~
@1220 = ~We can be two elves making it through here together. We'll survive.~
@1221 = ~Then we'll stay here for little time as possible.~
@1222 = ~Well, get it together. We are here whether you like it or not.~
@1223 = ~(She doesn't squeeze back at first, before her fingers clinch yours with a stressed tightness.)~
@1224 = ~I suppose that...helps a bit. Let us just get out of here as quickly as we can. Corellon's gaze does not reach into places like this.~
@1225 = ~I hope we do, <CHARNAME>. I truly hope we do.~
@1226 = ~Good. By Correlon, I pray we avoid as much drow as we can.~
@1227 = ~You are...ugh. "Get it together", <PRO_HESHE> says. Hrmph.~
@1228 = ~Well forgive me for shouting. I am just horribly distressed about everything going on with you. With us. It is only getting worse.~
@1229 = ~Great. We are now in one of their cities. If it weren't for this skin, I would be screaming and blasting my magic at everything.~
@1230 = ~You seem increasingly unhappy.~
@1231 = ~It is only temporary. Take it easy.~
@1232 = ~Shh. Don't get attention turned our way.~
@1233 = ~This is *definitely* not the time, Vienxay.~
@1234 = ~We are in a city. Full of drow. Not just the Underdark now. Have we lost it? Has the father abandoned me?~
@1235 = ~Please, please, pull it together Vienxay. We cannot afford needless attention.~
@1236 = ~And I am here with you. And I will always be if you let me be your comfort.~
@1237 = ~For the love of all, shut up. Shut up. Shut up!~
@1238 = ~Ugh! Your path is intolerable sometimes. Fine, fine, fine!~ ~16.4~
@1239 = ~No, we really, really can't. Hrmph. I...will keep it down. For the sake of us all.~
@1240 = ~Then...stay close to me while we are down here. Remind me of your comfort, of your presence. I will truly, truly need it.~
@1241 = ~It is such a relief to be free from that dreadful place...and to be greeted by good elven people.~
@1242 = ~They seem to be holding secrets from us. But at least they aren't hostile.~
@1243 = ~I am glad to be out of that place.~
@1244 = ~You seem to be doing much better now, Vienxay.~
@1245 = ~They may not seem friendly to outsiders, but they wouldn't hurt us.~
@1246 = ~Thank Correlon. I hated that place.~
@1247 = ~Much better. The sun, the sky, the clouds. This is where I should be.~
@1248 = ~(She pulls you closer suddenly to her lips to kiss you. Her hands reach around to hold you to her.)~
@1249 = ~We have somehow made it this far. Perhaps...perhaps we can really beat this mage, if you are still insistent.~
@1250 = ~I am. I must.~
@1251 = ~It is the only way to get my soul back.~
@1252 = ~I'm glad that you're coming around to this more.~
@1253 = ~Let us continue the pursuit, to whatever damn end it brings us.~
@1254 = ~After all that horror...we survived. We are strong. We *are* powerful. And that perhaps we are truly able to stop this Irenicus.~
@1255 = ~My people...my kin...so many bodies.~
@1256 = ~We will stop him, Vienxay. Together. We will save who we can.~
@1257 = ~And there will be more, unless we do something about it.~
@1258 = ~Come now, love. We have to keep moving.~
@1259 = ~Y-yes. Let us...let us obliterate that man and tear him asunder! Let us see him dead ten times over for what he has done.~
@1260 = ~Kill him, <CHARNAME>.  No mercy, no second chances. Kill him and make him suffer.~
@1261 = ~I don't want to make him suffer. I just want my soul back.~
@1262 = ~Gladly, Vienxay.~
@1263 = ~With all of the things he is done? There is no way I will be merciful.~
@1264 = ~You do not feel vengeful? Perhaps you are more focused than I am. But so long as we stop him...I do not care.~
@1265 = ~Good. I will give him a thousand stabs and shadow bolts, whatever it takes to put him down.~
@1266 = ~You speak of Dragonspear? I am not the same person as I was then, not so weak and desiring to fill that hole the loss of my homeland created.~
@1267 = ~And yet you were sweet and treated me well. You still treat me well. I am...quite grateful for that.~
@1268 = ~But I cannot just give you what you desire. Time has passed. Circumstances are different...but if you are truly insistent, let us wait and see if we still even have chemistry.~
@1269 = ~I think it is foolish, love makes you weaker, more distracted. But you are quite stubborn.~
@1270 = ~That I am. I'd like to see what happens.~
@1271 = ~ I'll wait for now.~
@1272 = ~If you think it is foolish, don't bother. I'll not waste time.~
@1273 = ~Hrmph. As stubborn as I said you were. I will admit I am flattered, and intrigued and e- ugh. I will admit nothing more!~
@1274 = ~Good. This is the best for us all, then.~
@1275 = ~And do you really enjoy having an audience?~
@1276 = ~I'll just...not look.~
@1277 = ~Bah. Don't we have battles to get to?~
@1278 = ~What? I'm not staring at all.~
@1279 = ~Well...love is love.~
@1280 = ~Whatever. Get over here.~
@1281 = ~Mmm. Now that was deserved delight.~
@1282 = ~Well. I am not going to make this flowery or step softly, so I am going to be quite blunt with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1283 = ~I was desired by many in Evermeet. Lately, despite us being together, you have treated me horribly. I have better standards, and you have utterly failed them.~
@1284 = ~So you and I are no longer a we. I am through with you.~
@1285 = ~Vienxay, I'm sorry. Forgive me.~
@1286 = ~It's just a bad time for me to be close with anyone. Maybe this is for the best.~
@1287 = ~As you often say, "Whatever".~
@1288 = ~It is far, far, too late for that.~
@1289 = ~You could have figured that out before you got yourself close to me.~
@1290 = ~Ugh!~
@1291 = ~Well, I'll be leaving then. No reason to stay around after a proclamation like this.~
@1292 = ~Agreed. Leave, please.~
@1293 = ~Leave. And give me your equipment.~
@1294 = ~I still need you, Vienxay, and want your company, even if it's just as friends.~
@1295 = ~Hrmph. Goodbye... and good luck.~
@1296 = ~Whatever. Have it. I'm out of here.~
@1297 = ~I...I will stay. For you. I...suppose I admit I still care. I will try to see this to the end.~
@1298 = ~I'm done here. Be fools if you wish but you do so without me.~ [VieBreak]
@1299 = ~I have seen you blunder about long enough. And you have little regard for me, and I? Even far less for you.~
@1300 = ~Blundering about, Vienxay? I saved you. Remember that.~
@1301 = ~What did I even do wrong?~
@1302 = ~If I did something to hurt you, I apologize.~
@1303 = ~And I think I have more than repaid you by now. Debts do not make me your slave.~
@1304 = ~If you even have to ask now, then you are sorely in need of clerical help. Help that I will not wait around to see it's progress of.~
@1305 = ~Please. You are apologizing now? Now?!~
@1306 = ~It is time for us to separate our paths.~
@1307 = ~Then get out of my sight.~
@1308 = ~Go ahead. But your equipment? That's mine.~
@1309 = ~Vienxay, please. Just give me one more chance to make this up to you.~
@1310 = ~Gladly! Hrmph.~
@1311 = ~What?! Fine. But watch your pockets if we cross again. I will not forget this.~
@1312 = ~Ugh, begging makes you so weak. *Sigh*. Fine. But only one. Don't ruin it.~
@1313 = ~I can stomach this no longer! You have had your chance and it is far wasted!~
@1314 = ~I'm done here. Done, done, done! And there is nothing more to be said on it. Goodbye!~
@1315 = ~Yes?~ [VienCom1]
@1316 = ~Let me ask you a question.~
@1317 = ~I want to ask something private.~
@1318 = ~Never mind.~
@1319 = ~Your desire?~ [VienCom3]
@1320 = ~I have something I want to ask.~
@1321 = ~Can I ask something personal?~
@1322 = ~You'll prod anyway one way or another.~
@1323 = ~Ask away.~
@1324 = ~Can you tell me a bit about your home, Evermeet?~
@1325 = ~Can you tell me more about your family?~
@1326 = ~I'd like to know more about the details of your exile.~
@1327 = ~Can you tell me more about your mentor?~
@1328 = ~Do you often get in trouble with the law?~
@1329 = ~Let's talk about something else.~
@1330 = ~Never mind. Let's keep moving.~
@1331 = ~I can't stop you, so ask.~
@1332 = ~That's all I had to ask. Let's keep moving.~
@1333 = ~I suppose I cannot blame you for being hungry to know about my great home. There is nothing like it in the realms.~
@1334 = ~My homeland is an island far to the west, with nature untainted as it should be. We build around it, or with it for our homes, allowing the forests to remain splendorous with their trees and lakes. Buildings would rise into the sky, and the walk ways would wrap around trees and nests, leaving them undisturbed~
@1335 = ~Only elves could call this place home. No other were allowed to set foot there, and we maintained this with both force and magic. This kept our people safe, who were never poor nor never starving. All were taken care of and loved.~
@1336 = ~Did anyone ever force their way?~
@1337 = ~No exceptions?~
@1338 = ~It sounds so different from the rest of the world.~
@1339 = ~Some have tried. Pirates, Drow, orcs. All have failed. Not a single one of them stepped on the foot of our soil. Evermeet's navy is second to none.~
@1340 = ~Were there no visiting exceptions?~
@1341 = ~None. So many of our empires to the east of Evermeet had fallen when trust was given to outsiders. Our people needed a sanctuary unsoiled. And this lesson has proven to work well under Queen Moonflower's guidance.~
@1342 = ~Perhaps in that some other cities have walls and are distrusting of outsiders? I have seen none do so to the success and extent of my people, while also respecting the world it lives in. But you are entitled to your beliefs.~
@1343 = ~My father held the responsibility as the Treasurer of Evermeet, giving financial advice to both the Queen and her council. He was brilliant with money, but less with people. My mother thus was often beside him as she was better at the talking.~
@1344 = ~I have two younger sisters, the youngest a bit naive and airy, but sweet and good. And the other often finding trouble, but always managing to get out of it.~
@1345 = ~I miss them terribly. I have not heard from them since I was exiled.~
@1346 = ~Have you not tried to contact them?~
@1347 = ~Perhaps they are ashamed of you.~
@1348 = ~That must be difficult.~
@1349 = ~Why would I? I put them through public shame. I do not even know if my father is still entrusted with the job he had. Every time I want to, that I begin to scrawl something...I tear it up.~
@1350 = ~My sisters, no. They believe I am innocent. My father and mother, yes. They know the truth.~
@1351 = ~It is, but it is part of the punishment. Often more suffer than just ourselves when we commit a crime. At least when I get in trouble with the law in these human lands, it is just myself that suffers.~
@1352 = ~One day I will reach out to them. One day.~
@1353 = ~Let's keep moving.~
@1354 = ~There is little to tell. I was involved with a Sharran, my mentor, and her methods of magic. I did not know this at first, she was mostly teaching me shadow magic, which I had an innate gift for.~
@1355 = ~I learned gradually that she was using our own people as experiments, and killing them. I planned to betray her with this knowledge, but while I was getting some..."stress relief" with an elf, my lover at the time barged in on us and I felt frightened.~
@1356 = ~I used one of the spells she taught me with no idea it was of Shar's weave and killed him on accident. His death, and later all of the others my mentor had caused, were pinned on me.~
@1357 = ~I have never used Shar's weave since.~
@1358 = ~I am surprised they didn't execute you.~
@1359 = ~Is there no way to appeal your sentence?~
@1360 = ~How can you unknowingly use Shar's weave?~
@1361 = ~As am I. Perhaps it was my father's high standing in society, or perhaps our people's reluctance to kill one another. But to live is the greater shame.~
@1362 = ~The public watched me get bound, watched my forehead get marked, watched me get thrust into a ship, and sent to this land with only my clothes and a bit of gold.~
@1363 = ~None that I know of.~
@1364 = ~Using the Shadow Weave does not require devotion to Shar. But there is a cost of the self. Had I kept attempting to use the weave without devoting myself to her, I would have likely lost my sanity and my connection to Mystra's weave.~
@1365 = ~I had believed the magic was merely an extension of Shadow Magic. And when so little is known of the Shadow Weave, tricking is not too difficult for those who are hungry for knowledge.~
@1366 = ~My lesson is well learned, and I will never do it again. Not even if you begged me.~
@1367 = ~I know little but that she was not born in Evermeet and believed that she could lie and deceive to the other elves to get away with the experiments she needed.~
@1368 = ~She was also a skilled Shadowdancer. Even if my people had known most of the murders done were her fault and not mine...she could have easily escaped if she so chose.~
@1369 = ~After seeking revenge for so long against her, I must admit it makes me feel...purposeless.~
@1370 = ~Hrmph. Human civilizations have very strange laws and customs both. Whine or pay a guard enough and you can get anyone in trouble for anything you like.~
@1371 = ~The guards however, do enjoy bothering me more than most. I have yet to figure out why.~
@1372 = ~Perhaps it is your hostility towards them.~
@1373 = ~Really? You can't even imagine in the slightest?~
@1374 = ~You're still probably adjusting to life away from Evermeet.~
@1375 = ~Or it is their corruption and inability to be proper protectors of the people. I think that is a far more likely reason.~
@1376 = ~Well, clearly it is their corruption and inability to be proper protectors of the people. If they were anything like the guards in Evermeet I would not have this problem.~
@1377 = ~Perhaps I am just still learning the ways of the people here. But do know I am a Shadowdancer. In time I can find a way out of anywhere, and then they would know who is truly in control.~
@1378 = ~Well we don't have privacy. But you can ask.~
@1379 = ~Back in Dragonspear...is there still anything between us?~
@1380 = ~I'd like to spend time together when we next rest in a safe place~
@1381 = ~(Kiss her)~
@1382 = ~Are all elves from Evermeet as attractive as you are?~
@1383 = ~I think we should end our relationship.~
@1384 = ~Nothing actually. Let's keep moving.~
@1385 = ~Well it is just you and me. Speak.~
@1386 = ~I'd like to spend time together when we next rest in a safe place.~
@1387 = ~I think we should end this.~
@1388 = ~Hrmph. If you really want to, I guess.~
@1389 = ~Are there nights you are not planning to spend near me? I'll be expecting your presence.~
@1390 = ~Mmm. When we get a chance to rest, I will be giving you more of those in different places.~
@1391 = ~What a very forward comment. Is this technique common with the local customs?~
@1392 = ~We who hail of Evermeet pride ourselves on our beauty, male or female, noble or commoner.~
@1393 = ~As for your question, I aim to be pleasing to the eyes, to be more beautiful than anyone else. But I will admit, you appear rather attractive yourself.~
@1394 = ~Ah, two attractive people then. What should we do about that?~
@1395 = ~You are certainly very pleasing.~
@1396 = ~Are you always so full of yourself?~
@1397 = ~A good question. Perhaps we should think about it and come back with an answer later. I can think of some fun things...but we shall see.~
@1398 = ~I could show you just how much. But now isn't the time for it. Perhaps...in time you may come to know of what I speak.~
@1399 = ~You just gave me the compliment. If you are irritated with my reaction then you shouldn't say it.~
@1400 = ~If you said it only to test me, congratulations, you've learned that I value myself. Now let's not speak of this again.~
@1401 = ~I assume you mean...our relationship.~
@1402 = ~Then it is done. Think nothing more of it, then! I won't...not at all.~
@1403 = ~Your voice sounds funny.~
@1404 = ~Excuse me? My voice is just fine, I just need some water. Let me get a drink.~
@1405 = ~Blast. Sules'terim...he's dead.~
@1406 = ~What was the point of any of this? Maybe Galadin had a point. Before this, I sought revenge, and power. I should have never let myself be weak. I should have never let myself be used.~
@1407 = ~He's dead now, along with whatever plans he had with him.~
@1408 = ~It's okay, Vienxay. We all have our weak moments.~
@1409 = ~Don't blame yourself. You had no way of knowing.~
@1410 = ~I know, but we can't idle here any longer. Urgent matters await us.~
@1411 = ~Yes, dead, and with him, my last hope for home.~
@1412 = ~I won't let myself be weak and make mistakes like this anymore. Never will the people of my home hurt me again.~
@1413 = ~I lost everything. All I have is my innate gifts with the shadows left. All my other spells, it is like the words don't resonate with me anymore, like there is some inner resistance blocking it from forming.~
@1414 = ~What a fool I am.~
@1415 = ~You weren't a fool. You did the right thing, Galadin was just a bad person.~
@1416 = ~Now we know better.~
@1417 = ~I encouraged you to do it. It's my fault.~
@1418 = ~It's not your fault. I wanted to do it. It's Galadin's. And he deserved all he got for it and more.~
@1419 = ~I know you are right. I just hate the cost of it.~
@1420 = ~But that doesn't make me feel better.~
@1421 = ~The worst part is...it felt right. It felt...good. And that just makes me more bitter.~
@1422 = ~Ugh, let's just forget about this. I don't want to dwell on it further right now.~
@1423 = ~This would have been very useful *before* I lost most of my access to the weave.~
@1424  = ~Oh, I have longed for this moment. No more running. This is it. This is the moment where I will have my vengeance, for <CHARNAME> and my people both! Prepare to be overwhelmed by my mastery of the art of shadows!~
//Not likely to be the case, but also shadowdancer checked.
@1425 = ~I should confess something to you. Something that I was trying with my magic before that mess with Galadin.~
@1426 = ~I was trying to improve my divination, and have been sort of using you to practice. A sort of spell to help divine your "aura", so to speak, and understand more of yourself.~
@1427 = ~And what did you see with your spell?~
//Isaac Spellhold LIne
@1428 = ~He won't get away with it, whatever that mage did to you. We'll see to that.~
@1429 = ~Don't be shy on our sakes.~
@1430 = ~(You notice out of nowhere Vienxay appearing in your shadow beside you, giving you a look over.)~
@1431 = ~You would do well to be more careful. If I can get so close to you like this...imagine what someone less likeable than I could do.~
@1432 = ~Walk by my side a moment...I want to know what goes on in that mind of yours. What are you thinking about right now?~
@1433 = ~I'm thinking about how to answer your question.~
@1434 = ~I'm trying to plan for the troubles that await us ahead.~
@1435 = ~That's private.~
@1436 = ~Food.~
@1437 = ~How I seduce the great Vienxay of House Starlight.~
@1438 = ~Ugh, you're so boring.~
@1439 = ~Predictable. But if you want to do that, perhaps take some of my input. I'm good at what I do.~
@1440 = ~Really? Just food? How basic.~
@1441 = ~Are you now? I eagerly look forward to how you play that game.~
@1442 = ~Don't bother. I bet any seduction of her requires kissing of her prissy little toes.~
@1443 = ~Oh jealousy looks so good on you, Emily.~
@1444 = ~Heh. I'm thinking of food too.~
@1445 = ~Yes, well, no one asked you, halfling. Hrmph.~
@1446 = ~Ha! Tell another joke, elf.~
@1447 = ~The next time the dwarf squeals something rude, I can't promise it won't be in the form of a pig.~
@1448 = ~I'm sure <CHARNAME> will fill us in when needed. Even you can respect that.~
@1449 = ~I know you play servant in your little group, Isaac, but I don't heed to others in that way.~
@1450 = ~How is this elf still alive with how she acts, I'll never know.~
@1451 = ~Pitiful. A simple question, a simple answer. But now I'm not interested.~
@1452 = ~Heehee. A practical response, if nothing else.~
@1453 = ~"Heehee". You giggle at everything, gnome. It's rather annoying. Mind your own business.~
@1454 = ~You really should mind your manners, Vienxay. You'd have more friends.~
@1455 = ~I still remember our time together back in Baldur's Gate. Our struggle to survive on the road, only to surmount the obstacle and achieve every victory we tasted...while looking good doing it. We must be the envy of any adventurer's eye.~
@1456 = ~(Vienxay looks you up and down, before smirking with a grin.) For a <PRO_RACE>...you still manage to look half-decent while covered in dry blood and soot.~
@1457 = ~I do get lonely at night when we rest at camp...(Vienxay lets the air linger as she traces a finger up your arm.) Perhaps you should remedy that sometime?~
@1458 = ~Why would they spend time with you when you would just belittle them like you always do?~
@1459 = ~I belittle people of no signifiance...such as yourself, mutt. <CHARNAME> is made of greatness...and deserves equally worthy attention.~
@1460 = ~Something tells me that would not be a fun time for anyone.~
@1461 = ~Mind your own business, shorty.~
@1462 = ~Heh, if you want to have a bad time with the batty elf, suit yourself, mate.~
@1463 = ~(She leans towards your ear, her breath hot and tingly as she whispers.) My wounds are...getting to me. If you could indulge me and let my poor, aching body rest for a while, I will be sure to make it up to you...~
@1464 = ~Everytime I catch you looking at me I wonder...(She pauses and whispers in your ear.) just how pent up you must be with something so wondrous that you cannot easily have.~
@1465 = ~(Her closeness allows you to get a proper look at her. She is sleek, graceful, with a hint of muscle and undeniable beauty. But most of all, she radiances haughty vanity, a self-confidence that has been more attractive than off-putting as of late.)~
@1466 = ~(You feel Vienxay bump you with her elbow to grab your attention.) Admit it, group leader. I am your favorite elf. And don't worry, you're my favorite <PRO_RACE>, too.~
@1467 = ~The way she says that, it just doesn't feel like a compliment.~
@1468 = ~What? Not me? Damn.~
@1469 = ~And I'm your favorite halfling!~
@1470 = ~Shut up, Kale.~
@1471 = ~You and I...we'll have this place cleared out in no time. Even faster with just us, I bet. Our abilities just sync in perfect chemistry.~
@1472 = ~If ye do that, feel free to come back out without her, <CHARNAME>. We'd be better for it.~
@1473 = ~Hmph. I sincerely doubt that.~
@1474 = ~(She suddenly falls back, even trailing behind the group as she looks away. Her haughtiness breaks and her normally proud cheeks crestfallen into solemnity as she gazes away.) Evermeet...my family...how I miss you both.~
@1475 = ~(She leans close to you to whisper) My bedroll is open tonight, if you wish to help me with...personal matters. (She leaves a kiss on your cheek, the heat of her lips promising pleasures to await.)~
@1476 = ~(She gazes at your pack and belongings, even placing a hand on a thing or two before she catches your eye.) Oh, I'm just seeing what we could do with all of this stuff. Sell it for a fortune and a few nights of luxury? You do have a tendency to pick up every little trinket you find. May as well make some wealth from it.~
@1477 = ~Donating is always an option.~
@1478 = ~No wonder why the temple of Oghma looked so destitute.~
@1479 = ~She has a point for once. if luxury is exchanged for items of power.~
@1480 = ~Well, that too. Two in agreement, I think you should heed our advice.~
@1481 = ~If it be for fighting, let it be saved for fighting. Not for yer pompousness's latest floral scent.~
@1482 = ~You could do with any scent at all to cover up your smell, dwarf.~
@1483 = ~Well, if we're talking about luxuries...how about color-coordinated shining capes?~
@1484 = ~Gods. Never. Forget it all.~
@1485 = ~(She then dissapears from your view, and you whirl around confused until you see her on the other side.) That never gets old.~
@1486 = ~Do you know how flexibile I am? I don't show it off in battle, but ask, and I can show you stretches that will leave you breathless.~
@1487 = ~Wow. Speechless. Literally.~
@1488 = ~Whelp. My mind's already gone down south. Not my fault, can't help it.~
@1489 = ~Do it around me and I'll leave ye breathless, elf.~
@1490 = ~Um, those words...did not come out the way you wanted them to sound, Helga.~
@1491 = ~Blast, you made it worse, Helga. Yondalla, clear my head, clear my head.~
@1492 = ~I'm still conflicted on your need to do good. I see it as such a waste of time and yet...the way people look at you like you are the god that answered their prayers...I can see the appeal. Bask in it. You're worthy of it all.~
@1493 = ~You didn't ask, but just to answer...you do look quite good bloodied and beaten up. I could suckle you dry.~
@1494 = ~Nope. Stop it, Kale. Don't think that.~
@1495 = ~Ooookay. That was...not something I needed to hear.~
@1496 = ~Ooookay. I don't think he appreciates that kind of comment.~
@1497 = ~And I don't think he appreciates a squeamish prude, but you're a lost cause anyway, mutt.~
@1498 = ~Oh, do you two always have to do this?~
@1499 = ~Um...I think I'll leave that out of the journal if that happened.~
@1500 = ~Is this necessary to say out loud?~
@1501 = ~By Moradin, why must we suffer this?.~
@1502 = ~(She glides her hands down your arm admiredly as her eyes peer over your body.) Muscled <PRO_MANWOMAN> are not common in Evermeet...making you quite a fine specimen. If I could bring your body back to show...my old lovers would faint in jealousy. It would be a delight.~
@1503 = ~(You match gazes, Vienxay's soft green eyes peering at you as if waiting for you to say something, before huffing and peering away.)~
@1504 = ~(She's close enough that you can study the marking on her head, a marking that you wonder if it is infused with magic, or is merely a significant symbol of her exile.)~
@1505 = ~(And then she's not there at all. Your eyes squint into the night, trying to find her again when you start as she appears in front of you.)~
@1506 = ~I knew you were staring. Keep at it...but I might surprise you again.~
//Flirt = 2
@1507 = ~I like watching you move. You have this presence that you command that allures me. But now I'll walk next to you so you can't distract me.~
@1508 = ~Maybe I'll find a way to feel the weave like I did before. Maybe I won't. But the greater weakness to me isn't the loss of that magic...but the fear of the loss of you.~
@1509 = ~(She directs your attention to her, and then with little warning, pulls you in for a fierce kiss, hands snaking around your neck to secure you into her passion.)~
@1510 = ~Heh. Going right at it right here. I feel left out.~
@1511 = ~Don't ye dare bloody ask me to help with that.~
@1512 = ~How...romantic.~
@1513 = ~Kisses are really awkward to write into the records. What will the priests say?~
@1514 = ~Love. Do as you want.~
@1515 = ~(She tilts her head away from you as you realize her hand brushes against yours, again and again. You take it in yours and you catch her smiling secretly.)~
@1516 = ~I used to wake up everyday aching for Evermeet. But now I ache for you. You better make sure that ache is sated.~
@1517 = ~I used to hate asking for help from anyone. But I'm not so prideful now, so...will you tend to me later?~
@1518 = ~She said that so gently...bah. Ask and I'll help ye as well, Vienxay.~
@1519 = ~I'm still prideful enough not to ask you, Helga.~ 
@1520 = ~I used to think only of me, of how great I am, and how no one else mattered...but your ways rubbed off on me, <CHARNAME>. I still think I am great of course, but...I think you are too.~
@1521 = ~One more person is great in her world. Great change.~
@1522 = ~Pfft. Sounds like there's been no development at all.~
@1523 = ~(She takes your hand and places it on her heart.) Do you hear how quickly it beats? I thought of the most recent night where we laid together and it stirs such excitement. I hope you have an encore in you on our next night together.~
@1524 = ~(She caresses your face, unusually soft and gentle for Vienxay, and gives your cheek a quick kiss.) Don't let it get to that head of yours, but...that is thank you. For everything.~
@1525 = ~Heh. I wouldn't mind a thank you like that.~
@1526 = ~Only <CHARNAME> gets those. Go ask the short one. I'm sure she'll indulge you.~
@1527 = ~Oh really?~
@1528 = ~Erm...no. Sorry.~
@1529 = ~Over me dead body.~
@1530 = ~Oh come on! Won't even humor me. Sheesh.~
@1531 = ~You and I will take this place with our unyielding might! This is just another reaffirmation of our truth.~
@1532 = ~I admit...I yearn for the sort of...typical things bonded pairs do together with you. Just don't laugh at me if I indulge...you make it difficult.~
@1533 = ~Bonded pairs is rather strange phrase to use for lovers.~
@1534 = ~No one asked your opinion, Emily, go googly ogle someone else.~
@1535 = ~I can't help it, you're so cute together!~
@1536 = ~Uggggh.~
@1537 = ~(You notice Vienxay gaze about, and when no one seems to be looking at you, pull you into a hug from behind, hands easing and body leaning against yours in content.)~
@1538 = ~With my past bonds, I always saw most of them as play things or amusements to pass the time. But you...you truly have captured me. I am yours...but you are also mine. Don't forget that.~
@1539 = ~(She brushes her hand near your left thigh, and when you turn to see her, she vanishes to your other side, to tease the right.)~
@1540 = ~(When you turn again, she dissapears only to appear right in front of you.) Oh poor you. You can catch me later...and return your frustration tenfold.)~
@1541 = ~To think I was pathetically begging for your help with my problems back at the Friendly Arm Inn, only to wind up hand-in-hand with you, conquering any foe that faces us. How much we've grown together.~
@1542 = ~I still will never understand your kindness towards others...but I'll never part your side, even if you are a fool.~
@1543 = ~I know how stubborn you are about walking around bruised, bloodied, and battered...but if it gets you killed before I next get my lips to taste every scar, I will kill you again.~
@1544 = ~You ought to show more skin, <CHARNAME>. I want everyone to water at your attractive form only to despair when I capture your lips with mine.~
@1545 = ~I used to lay awake every night just dreaming of the pain of losing Evermeet. But now, sometimes I dream of the fear of losing you. Don't ever make that a reality.~
@1546 = ~(When she's sure no one is paying attention to the two of you, she pulls back her robe and flashes you her leg and thigh, before tucking it back into the confines of the robe.)~
@1547 = ~Let's take it easy for once. A bit of luxury for the two of us. A private room fit for a royal, a hot bath to soothe our aches. Indulge me, and I'll make sure any desires of yours become reality.~
@1548 = ~(Life's trials have left their mark on Vienxay, evident in the gentler contours of her demeanor and the warmth that radiates from her toward you. She sidles up to your side, and the blush that graces her cheeks, so foreign just a while back, now paints a vivid picture of her affection.)~
//PID Flirts

@1550 = ~(Uptight with her sense of superiority, you feel a want to break down Vienxay's walls to see what kind of heart lies underneath all that haughty beauty.)~
@1551 = ~(Every obstacle and struggle has only brought you and Vienxay tighter and more intimately together. She won't admit it, but through her eyes you can see a longing for your affection)~
@1552 = ~Why don't we spend time together next time we camp?~
@1553 = ~I suppose we can. As long as the moment is right. A dungeon with monsters possibly lurking around any corner couldn't sound less delightful.~
@1554 = ~How charming, that you still ask for my permission. I like it. You may...I'll make sure it's a satisfying time for us both.~
@1555 = ~(Kiss her cheek)~
@1556 = ~If you are going to insist on putting your lips on my cheek like that, best that you get the other cheek as well.~
@1557 = ~(You are almost worried you offended Vienxay as her lips curl into a sharp scowl, but then you see the fighting smile break through and brighten her cheeks.)~
@1558 = ~(Vienxay closes her eyes at the touch of her lips. Her face almost looks peaceful, her breath slow and relaxed.)~
@1559 = ~I don't understand your want to adore me, but I can't lie and say I don't like it.~
@1560 = ~I can't help but admire you, Vienxay.~
@1561 = ~I know. I'm that beautiful.~
@1562 = ~You should be more specific. But I'll take the flattery.~

@1566 = ~Don't squeeze so hard! I am delicate.~
@1567 = ~(She freezes at the hug, and then slowly wraps her own arms around you and exhales.)~
@1568 = ~I appreciate the adoration, but I'm not a doll. I have more...sophisticated needs.~
@1569 = ~(Vienxay lets you hold her as she rubs in a soothing circle around your upper back.) I'll admit it...I like hugs sometimes.~
@1570 = ~(Take her hand.)~
@1571 = ~(Vienxay rolls her eyes as you walk hand-in-hand.) I don't understand the need for this, but if it pleases you.)~
@1572 = ~(Vienxay huffs as you hold her hand, feigning annoyance. But the slippery smile peaking from her lips as she tries to hide it by turning away emerges right in your eye-view.)~
@1573 = ~(For a while Vienxay doesn't seem to return the grip you give her hand, until you feel a squeeze and see her eyes earnestly looking at you suddenly.)~
@1574 = ~Holding hands is so...childish. Adults like ourselves should do something more...adventurous.~
@1575 = ~(The scowl that forms on her face as you give her nose a nice boop brings a chuckle to yourself that only has her scowl all the more, before it evolves into a war of nose pokes as she lunges for your own nose.)~
@1576 = ~Oh you think you're funny, don't you? I am capable of powerful magic. Remember that, jokester.~
@1577 = ~Ugh! You are so...so frustrating!~
@1578 = ~(She gives your nose a harder boop in return that has you retract in pain.) Ha! I always get my revenge!~
@1579 = ~Thank you for traveling by my side, Vienxay.~
@1580 = ~Technically, I owed you and joined you for that reason. But even if the debt has been repaid by now...why would I ever want to be anywhere else?~
@1581 = ~I should be thanking you. I could have never done what I sought for myself without you.~
@1582 = ~Good. I'm glad you're grateful for me...I'll admit it's more than what most would admit to me.~
@1583 = ~Where does this come from? If you want something special from me, you can say it plainly. But I do enjoy the appreciation.~
@1584 = ~(Poke her nose)~
@1585 = ~Well...I wouldn't be doing anything else interesting. So I suppose I should thank you as well.~
@1586 = ~(Wink at her)~
@1587 = ~(Vienxay gives you an incredulous stare. You wink and wink again and she just turns away from you.)~
@1588 = ~(She winks back.)~
@1589 = ~What? Are you teasing me? I don't take that sort of thing lightly.~
@1590 = ~(When you're sure you have her attention, you give her a clear wink, and then another. She rolls her eyes but you see that smile forming, marking your victory.)~
@1591 = ~(Watch her)~
@1592 = ~(You watch Vienxay, seeing her hand trace across the marking on her head. Her eyes fall for a moment, and without words you can imagine her thoughts of home as mixed with strong emotions as your own thoughts to yours.)~
@1593 = ~(Vienxay is not quite like any other elf you know. Elitist, headstrong, but undeniably beautiful. She dresses to be seen and noticed, and yet speaks to keep at a distance. Yet perhaps that wall of haughtiness pulls you in even more.)~
@1594 = ~(You notice Vienxay's fingers trace over the single braid in the left side of her hair. You reckon it has cultural signifiance of her house or homeland, her fingers go to it often when seems idled in her own thoughts.)~
@1595 = ~(As you admire Vienxay, you notice she is taller than other elves, with long, hairless legs occassionaly bared from the swishing of her robe. You look up and notice she has caught you staring, her smirk shows she unoffended, and quite pleased to have ensnared your attention.)~
@1596 = ~I enjoy your flirtations, Vienxay, but its a bit distracting. Can you stop for a bit?~
@1597 = ~I've missed your flirtatiousness Vienxay. I wouldn't mind you giving me that attention again.~
@1598 = ~Oh fine. But don't come begging when you begin to miss my attention.~
@1599 = ~I knew you'd ask. Fine...I enjoy our little games anyway.~
@1600 = ~(Kiss her)~
@1601 = ~(Vienxay grasps you by the chin and pulls you even closer as you kiss her. You feel her tongue playing with yours and a slight nip on your lip before she withdraws, out of breath and eyes intently on yours.)~
@1602 = ~Mmm. This kiss shows that I am yours...but you are also *mine*.~
@1603 = ~(Vienxay's hand caresses your cheek as you kiss. It's suprisingly tender, Vienxay's hand moving all over your face in gentle adoration, and when you pull away you notice her eyes are slightly wet.)~
@1604 = ~Don't fuss about it...I was just...moved. That is all.~
@1605 = ~(Vienxay pulls you in tight with your arms, the kiss growing passionate and heated. You begin to worry it might be too intense for where you are right now as Vienxay withdraws.)~

@1607 = ~(Press your body against hers suggestively)~
@1608 = ~Are you trying to get me to moan? Because I can do the same...and I'll make sure everyone hears you.~
@1609 = ~Mmm. But you know what I really want? (She turns around and draws your hand between her legs and moans softly.)~
@1610 = ~(She grinds back against you, turning her head and giving you a deep kiss as you rub against eachother.)~
@1611 = ~I warn you...keep it up and we'll wind up naked right here, right now.~
@1612 = ~You're only going to work yourself up...and I'm going to keep you pent up until I'm sufficiently amused.~
@1613 = ~(Vienxay lets her hands wander briefly to your most intimiate place, drawing a gasp of excitement as she smirks.)~
@1614 = ~You are just insatiable...but then, so am I.~
@1615 = ~(She lets you guide her hands towards your thigh, then spins and catches your hand with her other.)~
@1616 = ~Nu-uh. That will have to wait...but I'll make the waiting worthwhile.~
@1617 = ~(Suggestively draw her hand towards your body)~
@1618 = ~(Give her bottom a smack.)~
@1619 = ~(You get a taste of just how vengeful Vienxay can be as she returns your bottom smack again, and again, smirking each time that she remains just out of reach of your retaliation.)~
@1620 = ~Are you sufficiently amused? Because Vienxay always gets her revenge. Remember that.~
@1621 = ~(Vienxay yelps as your hand connects. She glowers at you, scowling and huffing.) Just because I said you can be rough that one time doesn't mean you can hit like that.~
@1622 = ~(Vienxay retaliates. She seems so pleased with herself as you give your bottom a soothing rub from the sting.)~
@1623 = ~I suppose it can't be helped. I do have a nice bottom.~

@1631 = ~(Vienxay gasps as the door to the baths is opened and a hot, steamy tub is revealed with a warm ambiance.)~
@1632 = ~This is luxury we deserve. With some elven wine, it would be perfect.~
@1633 = ~(She undresses, flinging her clothes at you and then immersing herself in the water.) Now come over, get me real clean.~
@1634 = ~(You let your hands wander, cleaning her skin and crevices of the dirt and soot that has accumulated on her journey. She then guides her hand to more intimate locations as she whispers in your ear.)~
@1635 = ~Everywhere. Don't miss a spot.~
@1636 = ~(By the time you leave the water, it has cooled but you still feel quite warm and happy inside with the activities you indulged in.)~

@1640 = ~I'm not like this with anyone but you. You know that, right? Only you...can make me feel so weak, and so happy.~
@1641 = ~(When she's finished cleaning you, she pulls you in for a long kiss, before exiting the water.)~
@1642 = ~(You guide Vienxay to a private stream. She doesn't seem enthused about the place, but immerses herself in the water with a sigh.)~
@1643 = ~Close your eyes. This stream is nothing to what I had home. I want you to imagine it...warm, clear water, the fish swimming around you, trees as high as you can see.~

@1650 = ~(After you step out of the water, Vienxay gives your bottom a smack with a smirk.) Now I know why I chose you. Somehow, I find your games with me to be such fun.~
