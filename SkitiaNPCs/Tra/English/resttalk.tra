@120  = ~Make yourself comfortable!~
@121  = ~It's nice to have a glass when we have the opportunity. Just something to simmer down and relax from our quest and all the danger it entails.~
@122  = ~Is this how you would relax back home?~
@123  = ~You could drink wine while on the road, too.~
@124  = ~We can never get too comfortable, Emily. We always have to be alert.~
@125  = ~Erm, with friends. But you are always comfortable in the estate, unless there was some family fight that had just happened. So I never felt the need.~
@126  = ~Ha, I know. But it's not the same as relaxing in an actual inn or home.~
@127  = ~I know why you say that. I don't think I could live with a mindset that was always looking behind her. I guess that's why I'm glad to be traveling in a group and not alone.~
@128  = ~But I don't regret leaving home. No matter what happens, I don't think that will change. Do you feel the same?~
@129  = ~I never had the choice to regret, Emily.~
@130  = ~About you leaving home? I definitely am happy that you did.~
@131  = ~Sometimes I wish I had a more comfortable life.~
@132  = ~I see. I forget that the choice isn't always there for everyone.~
@133  = ~Uh, I meant you! Not me. Oh never mind. I'm glad for your response all the same.~
@134  = ~I think one day, you may get that chance. Maybe.~
@135  = ~(Her lips taste of the sweetness of wine. She withdraws after she allows you a short while, too short for your liking.)~
@136  = ~Mmm. If we weren't in public I'd have let you have a few more of those.~
@137  = ~Ha. Charming flatterer. Not that I mind.~
@138  = ~What did you want to talk about?~
@139  = ~I wanted to check on you and see if you were all right.~
@140  = ~I was wondering if you had any stories to share.~
@141  = ~I wanted advice about our journey.~
@142  = ~Never mind actually. Let's get some rest.~
@143  = ~Never mind actually. I'm going to go get some rest.~
@144  = ~Stay and talk for a while?~
@145  = ~How are you doing?~
@146  = ~Tell me a story about yourself.~
@147  = ~Do you have any advice about our journey?~
@148  = ~I'm sorry. I should get some rest.~
@149  = ~Well, I'm game. What do you want to talk about?~
@150  = ~Just fine. I appreciate you checking on me.~
@151  = ~Just fine, love. I appreciate you checking on me.~
@152  = ~No lingering wounds, just some minor things at the most.~
@153  = ~I love it when you worry about me. But I'm fine, I promise.~
@154  = ~A few scratches and bruises. This one here looks like it will form into a pretty scar.~
@155  = ~I'm definitely sore from my wounds. I hope I still look pleasing to you.~
@156  = ~I'm in a bit of pain to be honest. But seeing you makes it a little easier to smile despite that.~
@157  = ~I'm in a bit of pain, but it will take care of itself with some rest.~
@158  = ~You seem to be doing well. I'm glad for that.~
@159  = ~I should get some rest.~
@160  = ~You seem to be okay yourself. It seems no matter how many times you get knocked, you seem to just keep going though. Definitely impressive.~
@161  = ~I am just glad you are all right. I am here to help you, my love. I'd be a failure if you were seriously hurt or killed.~
@162  = ~Let's get some rest.~
@163  = ~As long as you are well, <CHARNAME>, then my heart is happy irregardless of if I'm hurt or not. Though definitely more happy if I'm not hurt.~
@164  = ~I know you are worried about me...your injuries are pretty strenuous. I hope you take some time to tend to them.~
@165  = ~But don't worry about me. You're pretty hurt yourself. But I guess we're both alive.~
@166  = ~But here you are asking me but look at you. I'm amazed at how much you can bear and still walk, my love.~
@167  = ~I am more worried about you, love. I know you can take almost anything, but sometimes your injuries scare me.~
@168  = ~Well, I could tell you about my travels from Tethyr all the way to Beregost long ago, when I first began my search for my mother.~
@169  = ~I had a horse. I don't think I ever told you. His name was Pesky. Yes, he was pesky, but noble and brave, too. I wasn't the best rider, but the journey is otherwise terribly long on foot.~
@170  = ~We were just about to cross the border out of Amn when I came upon a merchant couple who were ambushed by a couple of brigands. Their own horse has been slain and they were either about to lose their goods or their life.~
@171  = ~I managed to take down one with two good shots and scared the other away, but the merchant couple had no way to pull their cart anymore.~
@172  = ~Did you offer to help them?~
@173  = ~That was noble of you.~
@174  = ~They should have hired protection.~
@175  = ~Yes. I gave them Pesky.~
@176  = ~That must have been hard, to go without your horse.~
@177  = ~Sometimes you are too selfless, Emily.~
@178  = ~You traveled the rest of the way alone on foot?~
@179  = ~I don't know about that. It's not so hard to shoot an arrow at an unmoving bandit when the aren't paying attention.~
@180  = ~When they were dealt with, I decided to give them Pesky, so they wouldn't be stuck or forced to leave without their goods.~
@181  = ~I doubt they could afford it and turn a profit. I almost thought of offering myself but I really needed to get north, and they were going back towards Tethyr.~
@182  = ~So I gave them Pesky. It wasn't an easy decision, but I didn't want them to have to leave their goods behind with no one to carry the wagon.~
@183  = ~I like to believe that one day I'll run into the merchant couple and see Pesky again. Being a good horse. And pesky, of course.~
@184  = ~My legs were less appreciative, but it was amazing to be able to explore the country on foot. I learned a lot about staying out of sight and surviving the wilderness.~
@185  = ~I think it helped really prepare me for well, my time with you.~
@186  = ~Well, I can tell you one of my childhood stories of how I embarrassed myself and nearly revealed my heritage to everyone.~
@187  = ~So, as a member of a noble house, we were always required to attend social occasions we didn't always desire to. Father was entertaining a rival noble house to try to ease some tensions.~
@188  = ~There was a bard playing music and fine cooked wine and food, but their entire family was so old. One of them was trying to be friendly and asked me to dance.~
@189  = ~I kept stepping on his shoes over and over again, I did it so many times he started to get angry and thought I was doing it on purpose.~
@190  = ~Were you that clumsy?~
@191  = ~His poor feet.~
@192  = ~If you need dance lessons, I could help.~
@193  = ~Clumsy? No. Nervous? Very!~
@194  = ~Yeah...poor feet.~
@195  = ~I wouldn't mind. But I've gotten much better. I was pretty much forced to have lessons for weeks after that.~
@196  = ~He had moved to slap me but hit the hat I was wearing. Father was mortified, and Thomas had charged over to pull him away.~
@197  = ~I slipped it on before anyone could notice and never told my brother thank you...I wish I did. It wasn't long after that we began to grow apart.~
@198  = ~You could have done it anytime afterwards.~
@199  = ~Is your brother really that bad?~
@200  = ~Could you be sure no one saw anything?~
@201  = ~I should have. Maybe I forgot or just wanted to forget that I didn't remember to be grateful for him.~
@202  = ~He wasn't then. And he isn't...evil now. Just...just not as caring of others.~
@203  = ~Part of me thinks Thomas did. But I also think he always knew. I wonder if he protected me for the family than myself, sometimes, but I still appreciated what he did.~
@204  = ~I just wish we were still as close.~
@205  = ~Oh, I can definitely think of one.~
@206  = ~A noble lady was before her lover. She desired him greatly, but did not know how to say it without being too forward.~
@207  = ~So she tapped her fingers on her lips and thought and thought, giving him a look that she hoped he could read.~
@208  = ~Oh? And how did he respond?~
@209  = ~Wait, are you...~
@210  = ~If you want to bed me, you only need to say so.~
@211  = ~You tell me.~
@212  = ~I am guessing he asked her what was wrong, confused still?~
@213  = ~Perhaps we should...retire and see how this plays out?~
@214  = ~That wouldn't be as cute, would it?~
@215  = ~Another time though. I am a bit weary.~
@216  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>.~
@217  = ~(She pulls you to her, giving you a fierce kiss, biting your lip slightly.)~
@218  = ~(Kiss her back.)~
@219  = ~Oh, so that's what you mean. Let's...retire, then.~
@220  = ~I love you dearly, Emily. But let's do this another night.~
@221  = ~I understand. But I hope that I am not kept wanting forever though, my love.~
@222  = ~Well, we are trying to raise money, aren't we? There are all sorts of people who need help. It may take some time, but you could use this opportunity to really make a difference.~
@223  = ~Not everyone who needs help has money, Emily.~
@224  = ~I plan to.~
@225  = ~I need to get the coin as fast as I can. Time is of the essence.~
@226  = ~I know. But even those who can pay less shouldn't be ignored.~
@227  = ~You are our leader in the end, though. I'll do whatever you think is best. But I would be happy if we could make a good difference while we can.~
@228  = ~I am glad. I know not everyone can pay well, but...it is good to help these people while we can.~
@229  = ~And we'll want to be prepared if we're going to go against Cowled Wizards. Which is a very poor idea, if you are wondering. But I'll follow you wherever you point. Just don't point off a cliff.~
@230  = ~You must really care for her...or really despise the mage you were facing, then. I guess I can understand how you feel.~
@231  = ~That gold alone won't necessarily also buy us equipment. It could do well to be prepared. Getting killed trying to save her or even trying to earn the gold won't do anyone any good.~
@232  = ~I am not really comfortable working with these thieves. I am a bit worried we're even being conned.~
@233  = ~There isn't any other way, Emily.~
@234  = ~I don't think the other option was any better.~
@235  = ~They'll follow through or suffer the consequences.~
@236  = ~You are right. I do agree. Hopefully our faith in them isn't misplaced.~
@237  = ~I am not sure they are a group so easily wrangled to suffer the consequences. But! I hope it doesn't come to that.~
@238  = ~You know, if it were any other time, and there weren't pirates and criminals here, and there were at least some more decent people...this could be a nice spot for relaxation.~
@239  = ~But it's not. Honestly, the only advice I have? Just get our business done and get out of this place.~
@240  = ~That I can agree with.~
@241  = ~Not fond of pirates, then?~
@242  = ~I can see what you are saying. This would be a nice island if it wasn't pirate infested.~
@243  = ~Well then, we are two arrows in a quiver, aren't we?~
@244  = ~People who grope and rob you and smell of alcohol? Nope. Not one bit.~
@245  = ~Exactly...and maybe if you changed all the buildings. And took away the giant prison in the distance. Hrm, maybe it is hopeless.~
@246  = ~I don't think you need my advice on this, do you, <CHARNAME>.~
@247  = ~We have to stop Irenicus, and get back what you lost. There might be somethings to do first but...honestly as far as I know you are on borrowed time.~
@248  = ~Don't worry about me. I will be okay.~
@249  = ~Then we are in agreement on this.~
@250  = ~You are certain we can best him?~
@251  = ~I hope so, <CHARNAME>. We can't do this without you.~
@252  = ~Good. I like it when we agree on things!~
@253  = ~I don't know. I know that if we don't try, that we definitely can't. But that if we do, we *might* succeed, and that is good enough.~
@254  = ~Do you wish to erm...sleep with me?~
@255  = ~I would love to.~
@256  = ~I would rather sleep alone.~
@257  = ~Do you wish to cuddle with me?~
@258  = ~(You capture her lips with hers, and she eagerly tugs you over to her resting place.)~
@259  = ~(She grins and tugs you over to her resting place, before she hungrily moves to capture your lips with hers.)~
@260  = ~(She grins and tugs you over to her resting place, before she gives you a short, chaste kiss on the lips.)~
@261  = ~I understand. Come. (She takes your hand and tugs you over to her resting place, before she gives you a short, chaste kiss on the lips.)~
@262  = ~Rest then!~
@263  = ~Or, are you up for something..."else"?~
@264  = ~I can't say no to a beautiful lady.~
@265  = ~I'm down if you are.~
@266  = ~Let's just get some actual rest.~
@267  = ~As tempting as that sounds, we need sleep.~
@268  = ~It's getting late though. We should get some sleep.~
@269  = ~Rest well, <CHARNAME>.~
@270  = ~(You watch Emily draw back a bow string, arrow in hand. She takes a deep breath and lets it whisk off towards one of three target's she's quickly set up for herself. She turns and flashes a small smile as you approach.)~
@271  = ~I thought to get in some repetitions. Maybe to find a part of my form to improve on.~
@272  = ~Mind training me a bit with a bow?~
@273  = ~How about we spend the night together in your tent?~
@274  = ~How about we spend the night together in our tent?~
@275  = ~I'm a bit tired, I'll let you practice.~
@276  = ~(She grins after your display of affection, stroking your cheek.) I can't shoot if you are kissing me. But I guess I can take a break.~
@277  = ~Sure! Take my bow here.~
@278  = ~So. See that targets over there? Draw it back, keep it level with your shoulder, and then as you draw the arrow, hold your breathe. Once you release it, let both your air and the arrow fly.~
@279  = ~You can pick the far range, mid range, or close range target, whichever you want. Let's see how you do.~
@280  = ~(Let the arrow fly to the nearest target.)~
@281  = ~(Let the arrow fly to the middle target.)~
@282  = ~(Let the arrow fly to the furthest target.)~
@283  = ~Ah, on second thought, I'm rather tired. I'll let you shoot.~
@284  = ~Hrm, you missed. Care for another try? Remember, take a deep breath, and focus. Let it out when you are ready.~
@285  = ~I think I'm too tired for this. I'll let you shoot on your own.~
@286  = ~Ah, perfect! Perhaps you want to try one of the further ones, now?~
@287  = ~I'm a bit too tired to continue. I'll let you keep shooting and get some rest.~
@288  = ~Ah, that was a bad miss. Give it a second try. Remember to focus and know how the arrow arches and curves, and keep in mind any wind.~
@289  = ~(Let another arrow fly to the middle target.)~
@290  = ~Great work! Now if you dare, take on the furthest target as a challenge.~
@291  = ~It's a challenge, isn't it? Focus and take your time. Think of where your shot landed and adjust your position accordingly. You can do this.~
@292  = ~(Let another arrow fly to the furthest target.)~
@293  = ~Ah, well, that one was closer. I think you're just a bit tired. With more practice you'll have it down for sure.~
@294  = ~Ha, I don't think I'm cut out for archery.~
@295  = ~Thanks, Emily. I'll be sure to get it next time.~
@296  = ~I'll let you keep shooting and get some rest.~
@297  = ~Wow, that was impressive! It always takes me a couple to land that kind of distance.~
@298  = ~I might have to start learning from you at this rate!~
@299  = ~I guess it's not easy to get down in a day, but you didn't do that bad, honest.~
@300  = ~I know you will. You are brilliant, you know.~
@301  = ~(After taking back her bow, she takes you by the hand.) You are coming with me after that performance.~
@302  = ~Where are we going?~
@303  = ~I know what you are up to, but I really want to just get some rest.~
@304  = ~Oh. Well, do you wish to cuddle with me instead?~
@305  = ~(You find Emily inside her tent, sliding off her weapons and equipment against the sides as she prepares for resting.)~
@306  = ~Oh, hey!~
@307  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>! Nice to have a proper bed...as long as the ceiling doesn't suddenly collapse.~
@308  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>! Nice to have a proper bed...though the inn here is humbler than others.~
@309  = ~Would you like to bathe with me?~
@310  = ~Cuddle with me?~
@311  = ~Hrm. I don't know...let me think...~
@312  = ~(She brings you on to the bedding, kissing down, down, down...before she suddenly jerks back up and moves back to kiss your lips, straddling you with her legs.)~
@313  = ~(She merges you with her, whispering your name several times through your joined passion, until you are both a sweaty mess panting beside one another.)~
@314  = ~I'd like that.~
@315  = ~Well, after all of our time in Suldanessellar? Surviving. From what I am understanding we are certainly going to have a bountiful amount of danger.~
@316  = ~Are you suggesting we run?~
@317  = ~We'll survive. Don't worry about that.~
@318  = ~Nothing we haven't dealt with before, then.~
@319  = ~There is nowhere to run. We can only see this through. We've been to hell and back. I think we'll find a way. Hopefully, anyway.~
@320  = ~We've been to hell and back. I think I stopped worrying about surviving and started being baffled about our very interesting life choices we make.~
@321  = ~Exactly? Crazy, completely risky, and unreasonable decision-making that we somehow always make it with. If we can make it to hell and back, I think we can handle anything, now.~
@322  = ~It seems simple. Stop the Five, remain alive. And I didn't mean to rhyme there, it just happened.~
@323  = ~Each one of these bhaalspawn though are probably not going to be easy. We've already seen the extent of that.~
@324  = ~I agree with you on that.~
@325  = ~Not doubting us, are you?~
@326  = ~We'll stop them all. I am the greatest of the bhaalspawn.~
@327  = ~I'd hope so. It would be silly to underestimate them. But I think we can do this.~
@328  = ~I'm not. But I don't want to lose anyone either because we got a bit arrogant. We're more powerful than ever...we just can't let that get to our heads.~
@329  = ~You are very strong, <CHARNAME>. But if you let that get to your head, you'll do more harm than good for any of us. And I'm not keen on dying from underestimating my enemy if we can avoid it.~
@330  = ~Do you wish to...sleep together?~
@331  = ~Just some rest? Or are you thinking of...something else?~
@332  = ~You move to find Helga.~
@333  = ~You remember you asked Helga to spend a bit of time together before you rested.~
@334  = ~(Go see Helga.)~
@335  = ~(You find Helga sitting on the floor in her room, stretching her leg.)~
@336  = ~Nay a fan of these inns. Be a home or the road, but it be nice to give me back some comfort.~
@337  = ~Do you have a tale to share to pass the time?~
@338  = ~I wanted to see if you were all right.~
@339  = ~I wanted advice on our journey.~
@340  = ~(You find Helga sitting at a table, drinking a mug of ale.)~
@341  = ~Hrm. Dwarven brew here isn't half bad. Wonder which hall imported this.~
@342  = ~I'm a bit tired, I'm going to get some sleep.~
@343  = ~(Helga is preparing dinner, setting out a variety of ingredients for what appears to be a stew near a pot.)~
@344  = ~Isn't ready yet. But damn am I tired of rations. Been saving this until I had everything prepared.~
@345  = ~How about I cook for a change?~
@346  = ~(You find Helga praying quietly in her tent. She rises when she hears you step in.)~
@347  = ~Haela is pleased with our fights, I'd say. What do ye need?~
@348  = ~Aye, I do. Perhaps what every dwarf of Torstultok remembers most: their first kill.~
@349  = ~A grim story, I reckon.~
@350  = ~That sounds exciting, go on.~
@351  = ~On second thought, I'll just get some rest.~
@352  = ~Nay. A triumph.~
@353  = ~To become one of the priest's of Torstultok, one must prove their competency in battle. I had trained night and day with them, swinging and praying and working to earn Haela's favor.~
@354  = ~When it is time, they send you out with a torch, a shield and a hammer. Nay shield, for the way of the ruin is too dark to see. The mark: a cave troll.~
@355  = ~A troll? That's an insane creature to ask anyone to face without experience.~
@356  = ~Interesting, go on.~
@357  = ~They sent you to fight that alone?~
@358  = ~Aye. But those who serve in Torstultok were trained hard and well. We studied and learned of all the creatures of the Forlorn Hills. Trolls were nay uncommon, and I had studied them well from the stories of the others there.~
@359  = ~These trolls were independent and liked to be dominant unless courting one another. Fire was your friend, but the torch also made you an easy mark. Right when I thought my cave was empty save the echo of bats, ready to turn back and inform the keep there was nothing in sight, my torch went flying and my skin was cut with claws right here.~
@360  = ~I turned around and the beast was already going for a killing strike. I put up my shield arm and went for my hammer, ignoring the blood. Five hundred pounds of pure force that thing was. Dented me shield with his second hit. Keeping up a defense was impossible, and asking a blessing, more impossible still.~
@361  = ~I turned around a small corner with a few rock outcroppings to create distance. Ye think its weight made it slow? Damn thing was fast. Couldn't even get a cure spell to ease my pain for a moment finished without having to cease my incantation and block again.~
@362  = ~It beat my shield down to about nothing. Was thinking that it would be over soon. Thing was bent and battered like a bent fork.~
@363  = ~How did you prevail?~
@364  = ~That's not good.~
@365  = ~You had that difficult of a time?~
@366  = ~It was me first proper real battle. Ye remember yers? Nay so easy if you put a troll in the place of that.~
@367  = ~I decided to be aggressive after that. Slammed my hammer in its face and any open flesh that seemed a good mark. Surprised it at first, especially with a good slam on its knee, but one counter attack with its arm sent me flying back. Damn that wall I hit hurt.~
@368  = ~The creature was slowed though that I could make a quick blessing. Healing maybe, but I thought of Flamebolt instead. Called a burning sword into my hand, forced myself to my feet and met the creature in its charge.~
@369  = ~His arm was long, but my blade long itself and just a little faster. Cut its arm off with one good strike. Screamed like a shrill harpy it did, then mercifully took its head.~
@370  = ~I brought it back to Torstultok, and they helped heal the wounds I couldn't. Still proud of that day. Became an adult, in a way.~
@371  = ~A fine tale. Thank you, Helga.~
@372  = ~I suppose it passed the time. Thanks.~
@373  = ~That's it? I was expecting it to be more exciting.~
@374  = ~Ye be welcome.~
@375  = ~Nay sure how ye get more exciting then that. But as ye say.~
@376  = ~The night grows long. Best we turn in. But thank ye for the company. Rest well.~
@377  = ~Rest well. May Haela bless us in the battles to come.~
@378  = ~Aye, I do. Another first, if ye like.~
@379  = ~Sounds intriguing. Go on.~
@380  = ~What happens this time?~
@381  = ~On second thought, I'm more tired than I thought. I'll just get some rest.~
@382  = ~Ye'll see.~
@383  = ~As I told ye before, after my first kill I became a full fledged priest, which we call First Blood from my former novice rank, Unblooded.~
@384  = ~A wandering priest of Dumathoin had strong knowledge of a lost crown in one of the ruins desired by a surviving heir of the former empire, and had tasked the Hall of Torstultok to get it.~
@385  = ~Trolls had pushed back previous attempts, but we were troll killers, blood maidens and luck maidens collectively at that. Our seniors accepted without pause, and our juniors gladly filled the ranks.~
@386  = ~I was put in a crew of four meself, tasked with searching a particular vault once we were well inside. When we opened the door, scores and scores of lost gold filled the ground. Shining jewels and necklaces and rings. A thief's dream.~
@387  = ~A lucky find.~
@388  = ~What happened next?~
@389  = ~I hope you took some of it for yourself.~
@390  = ~So it seemed. But we were deceived.~
@391  = ~The temptation was there, aye. But my passion is battle, nay gold.~
@392  = ~Our highest standing priest, the rank of Sharp Axe, had run into one of the chests thinking it might hold what we were looking for within. Soon as we all searched a different corner, we heard a scream and the clanking of metal. The chest was eating Sharp Axe. It was a mimic.~
@393  = ~The Trolls had created them we think to keep their gold safe and make it unnecessary for them to watch the vaults. And it worked. The Sharp Axe was gone by the time we got over to it. We killed the Mimic with a vengeance...but it did nay bring Sharp Axe back.~
@394  = ~You can nay raise a dead creature that is not intact. We'd have raised a dwarf that was only pieces and he'd have died again, and we had no priests in the area who could resurrect, they were far away. I felt damn guilty for not keeping a watchful eye...and so that was my first experience of loss.~
@395  = ~Was he eventually resurrected?~
@396  = ~This is what you mean by first, then.~
@397  = ~A tragic story, but thank you for the tale.~
@398  = ~Nay. They ruled it was best not to do so. Resurrection has a price, ye know. Ye age or the victim weakens. Hardly a price for an elf or a dwarf, but those who were capable of it were too old. Still, it reminds me to always look out for yer comrades. Losing them hurts more than anything.~
@399  = ~Aye. That it did. First Blood is often followed soon by loss. Youth grows arrogant and thinks it self invulnerable. I did...and when I saw a comrade truly die, I quickly learned that it could have easily been me.~
@400  = ~Aye. Perhaps not the best story to rest after, but...sometimes I like to rest with some simmering thoughts.~
@401  = ~Aye. Perhaps a lighter telling this time.~
@402  = ~There was a small group of dwarves who had traveled to Torstultok to learn from the crusaders. One of them was a mite arrogant and prideful, so the crusaders pointed him to me for a challenge.~
@403  = ~And ye can bet I humbled him. This dwarf scoffed at the preference of a hammer over an axe, and claimed he could best any hammer wielder. In each of our skirmishes, I defeated him in less than ten moves.~
@404  = ~I got so tired of his pathetic complaining I hit him a bit hard on the last hit. Had to get his nose healed, heh.~
@405  = ~Remind me to never fight you, then.~
@406  = ~That's not very nice.~
@407  = ~I'm sure he learned well from that.~
@408  = ~Heh. I was a terror when I was younger. Faster on my feet. I long for the legs I had then.~
@409  = ~Nice? Training is nay the time to be nice. Besides, he bloody deserved it. A dwarf should know when to be humble and let his damn pride go.~
@410  = ~Aye. Very.~
@411  = ~He came around later that evening rather bitter. Offered to cook as some sort of reconciliation gesture. I let him thinking it would be another opportunity to humble him again.~
@412  = ~But he was the finest cook I've ever tasted from. Knew his meats and seasonings and did some beautiful cuts. Father was a chef who cooked for kings and the finest dwarven knights of the realm. Taught him everything.~
@413  = ~Now, I may have not liked his fighting, but I'm not dumb. Didn't let him out of my sight until he was properly my husband.~
@414  = ~Now that's amusing.~
@415  = ~Oh. This is the dwarf you had married.~
@416  = ~All along, this was another first story, isn't it?~
@417  = ~Heh. Ye always remember your firsts. He taught me my own cooking, here. I try to do my best, though I'm not as skilled as he was. I'll always miss the bloody bastard.~
@418  = ~Aye. Though it was more than his cooking. I suppose I was moved by his earnestness to improve things and talk of things beyond fighting. It was nice to have a friend that was nay just a battle friend, and eventually someone more then that. I miss him.~
@419  = ~I am fine. And me leg is holding up. That's all that matters.~
@420  = ~Raring to go after some rest. This dwarf is meant for swinging.~
@421  = ~Nay worry. Injuries mean a good battle was fought, and I'll be able to heal myself to full recovery in short time.~
@422  = ~Pain that can be mended, aye. The worst bother is my leg. Wish I were younger.~
@423  = ~Ye seem to have a knack for coming out well enough. Ye are made of stern stuff.~
@424  = ~Ye don't seem to be needing any healing yerself. Good.~
@425  = ~If ye need me to give ye some healing before ye rest, just let me know.~
@426  = ~Ye got some festering wounds. I'll see to them later.~
@427  = ~Ye really need advice? I think it's simple. Let's get filthy rich! Can stock up on some fine equipment while we're at it.~
@428  = ~That sounds like a good idea.~
@429  = ~Any suggestions on how though?~
@430  = ~I'd rather just get the money as fast as we can.~
@431  = ~Bah. Ye are probably wanting particulars though.~
@432  = ~In places like this, you could make a killing fighting. For show or for business. That be my suggestion on how we get the gold.~
@433  = ~The better equipment we have, the better we fight, and the more we can take on. Ye might think on rushing, but take yer time. The best battles are well prepared for.~
@434  = ~She be in a prison. Ain't going anywhere.~
@435  = ~Hrngh. Ye ask a good question.~
@436  = ~We choose these thieves so we are stuck with them, I suppose. Damn shame there wasn't any other option.~
@437  = ~We could have sided with the vampires.~
@438  = ~We'll make do.~
@439  = ~Bah. As I said: nay other option.~
@440  = ~I would bet they employ some dangerous killers. A good battle either way. Hopefully that will nay be necessary.~
@441  = ~Bah. We should be destroying not helping these creatures. I nay like it much, but the thieves were nay much better.~
@442  = ~They were the best choice to get where we need to.~
@443  = ~We can't destroy them. They are our only way.~
@444  = ~There wasn't much of a choice.~
@445  = ~Hrngh. I nay be so sure, but as ye say.~
@446  = ~Bah.~
@447  = ~There was the original choice, as pitiful that was.~
@448  = ~Let's just finish working with them and get to this bloody island, I say.~
@449  = ~Find this Irenicus. And smack him hard with a hammer.~
@450  = ~That I can agree with, except the weapon of choice.~
@451  = ~I doubt it will be so easy~
@452  = ~Bah. Ye get my meaning.~
@453  = ~The best battles are never easy. I look all the more forward to it.~
@454  = ~Aye. Nay true advice needed on this.~
@455  = ~It sounds simple to me.~
@456  = ~We chase down this git Irenicus and get yer soul back before ye rot into nothing. Neither natural to take or lose such things and live.~
@457  = ~I will be okay.~
@458  = ~It won't be easy to beat him, Helga.~
@459  = ~Nay. With enough time, ye won't be. I wouldn't dawdle around too much. ~
@460  = ~I'd be concerned if ye disagreed, but aye. We agree.~
@461  = ~Nay. But ye've no choice if ye want to live.~
@462  = ~Aye, aye! Take a seat. This is good ale, as I said. Pale and bitter, as it should be.~
@463  = ~I'll take a taste of it then.~
@464  = ~Drink up! What do you think?~
@465  = ~It's not bad.~
@466  = ~I think I'm going to regret that sip.~
@467  = ~It's unique. Is this what you usually drink?~
@468  = ~Good, good!~
@469  = ~Bah. I suppose nay all have the stomach for a fine brew.~
@470  = ~This is the stuff I try to get when I travel. Always satisfies before rest.~
@471  = ~Yer choice. A drink is a drink.~
@472  = ~Nay as tasty as the proper barreled stuff in a good dwarven hall.~
@473  = ~Strong and rich, ah I miss the good stuff. Been several good years since the last.~
@474  = ~You certainly seem to enjoy it.~
@475  = ~You might find its match.~
@476  = ~You can cook, but can you also brew?~
@477  = ~Aye. Anything that brings back memories of good times. I can remember all the comrades who have come and gone that I've shared a good table and ale with. I'll remember this moment well and good, too.~
@478  = ~Bah! Never. Not unless it be from a dwarf themselves.~
@479  = ~Nay. I don't carry the right things to brew on the road, and it's poor taste at best from those who do. Takes great skill to be a master brewer. Nay complaints if you find one to join us.~
@480  = ~Aye, sit sit!~
@481  = ~Ye like to reflect on the day's work when ye drink? My mind oft drifts to the hours before.~
@482  = ~I'd rather not think of anything like that. I just want to enjoy the moment.~
@483  = ~Yes. I often try to reflect.~
@484  = ~What's done is done. I'd rather be thinking ahead.~
@485  = ~Hrngh. I suppose if it is a hard day, I can see. But nay reflection means little means to improve oneself.~
@486  = ~Aye. Mistakes, and the victory. Difficult not to swell with pride when their are no faults to recall.~
@487  = ~Aye, I can see the merit in that. Suppose one does nay want to go unplanned.~
@488  = ~It ever burden ye? The weight of everything ye have to carry, being you.~
@489  = ~Often, yes.~
@490  = ~No, I'm just fine.~
@491  = ~I don't know. I've never really thought about it.~
@492  = ~Ye do it better than most. I'll say that much, if it helps put ye at ease even a little bit.~
@493  = ~Ye say that convincingly. But I nay know if I would feel that way in yer boots.~
@494  = ~Hrngh. I can nay imagine ever not thinking about it. I suppose there be a bit of bliss if ye can ignore it.~
@495  = ~Ye? Cook? We'll see if ye got what it takes.~
@496  = ~Got three different things ye can help with. The slicing of these vegetables, the seasoning, and the cooking of the meat.~
@497  = ~Now this particular type of meat is easy to undercook or burn. Pot will get hot fast. Just a warning if ye want to take the hardest challenge.~
@498  = ~I'll try my hand at slicing.~
@499  = ~Let me try the seasoning.~
@500  = ~I can take a crack at this meat.~
@501  = ~Ah, on second thought, I'll spare everyone's food and let you handle the cooking. I'll get some rest.~
@502  = ~Nay, nay, nay. Yer slicing is a mess. Ye think we eat slices like that. And ye'll ruin the flavor that way. I've got one more here, you can try one more time if ye like.~
@503  = ~(Try again.)~
@504  = ~I think I'm too tired to get this right. I'll let you handle this.~
@505  = ~Aye, looking good. Perhaps ye won't be hopeless if ye ever retire to a house.~
@506  = ~Ye want to keep helping? Could season yer work, or take on the meat cooking if ye like.~
@507  = ~I'm a bit too tired to continue. I'll let you handle the rest of this.~
@508  = ~Hrngh. Nay dump the seasoning like that. Take a taste...taste like ye grabbed water from a well of rubbish, I bet.~
@509  = ~I got one more slab here. If ye want to try again, be careful this time.~
@510  = ~Aye, aye. Now it be looking presentable.~
@511  = ~All that remains is the cooking, if yer up for the challenge.~
@512  = ~Bah, ye bloody burnt it. I got one more slab here...give it another try if ye like. But don't mess it up, else we'll be stuck with awful supplements for our rations for the next few days.~
@513  = ~Bah. Ye ruined enough food, I think. I'll take care of it from here.~
@514  = ~Sorry. I guess cooking isn't as easy as I thought.~
@515  = ~Maybe if you were a better teacher, I could have done it.~
@516  = ~Thanks. I'm going to get some sleep. I'll try some of your food in the morning.~
@517  = ~Perfect! I think everyone will like this when they've a bite to eat. Taste it...aye, perfect, as I said.~
@518  = ~Now that be a good dinner. Thank ye for the hand.~
@519  = ~Nay, it isn't. But with practice, ye get it down like anything else. Just takes a bit of wisdom to understand the bit of tricks involved.~
@520  = ~Grouch if ye please. Ye'll change yer tune once ye've had some rest and some actually well-done cooking when ye waken.~
@521  = ~Glad my leg is finally better now. But damn do our battles sure test that fortune.~
@522  = ~(Helga is preparing dinner, setting out a variety of ingredients for what appears to be for a soup near a pot.)~
@523  = ~Isn't ready yet. But damn am I bloody tired of rations. Probably said that many times now.~
@524  = ~Haela bless us. Ye need something?~
@525  = ~Nay. I have little to advice ye on.~
@526  = ~Really? That's surprising.~
@527  = ~I'll make do without it then.~
@528  = ~Oh? I was counting on your help.~
@529  = ~The path forming seems more of necessity than choice. Thus I have nay advice. Ye've done well this far. Ye'll figure out the way for us all.~
@530  = ~Aye, ye will and just fine. You've done well this far. Ye'll figure out the rest of the way for us all.~
@531  = ~Ye don't need it anymore. Ye've been leading us for a long time, and done well by us. Ye'll be fine.~
@532  = ~I say kill the five and let us be done with it.~
@533  = ~We killed that bloody giant. Nay any of the others will be unstoppable if he fell.~
@534  = ~You seem eager to be through with this.~
@535  = ~Yes. None of the Bhaalspawn can best me.~
@536  = ~Aye, ye have little choice to. Ignoring them seems like a fool's choice.~
@537  = ~Aye, it's been a long journey. But I be desiring a new path soon enough. But let us first survive this challenge.~
@538  = ~Aye. Nay any of them can. Believe that. Ye'll need it to pierce through any intimidation or fear they try to break you down with.~
@539  = ~You move to find Kale.~
@540  = ~You remember you asked Kale to spend a bit of time together before you rested.~
@541  = ~(Go see Kale.)~
@542  = ~(You find Kale in his room, taking off his armor and tunic and setting it aside).~
@543  = ~How's it going? Took a check, and it's a shame, I don't think I got any new scars.~
@544  = ~Show Kale your affections.~
@545  = ~Kiss him~
@546  = ~You look handsome.~
@547  = ~'Course. Speak away.~
@548  = ~Handsome, eh? I get that a lot. But it means a bit more coming from you.~
@549  = ~Soooo. What did you want to speak to me about?~
@550  = ~Want to talk about anything?~
@551  = ~Me mate? Couldn't be better.~
@552  = ~I'm in one piece, love. A good looking piece, I might add.~
@553  = ~Don't worry about me, mate. I'm all chipper.~
@554  = ~Don't stress love. Kale's hearty and healthy.~
@555  = ~A bit beat up, but no scars. Shame really.~
@556  = ~Heh, all of these wounds just means I was doing my job protecting folks. You can kiss them better later.~
@557  = ~Well. Not dead, love. That's what counts, eh?~
@558  = ~Well. Can't come out all right out of every misadventure we have. Sure some rest will do the trick~
@559  = ~You seem all right though. Good for you, mate.~
@560  = ~We're here to help you succeed though, and you seem to be coming around fine enough thanks to us, eh?~
@561  = ~But that doesn't matter. Long as I keep you well, I'm happy.~
@562  = ~You look hearty and happy. Means I'm being a good lover, heh.~
@563  = ~You though, don't look so good, mate. Definitely get some good rest in.~
@564  = ~You take a beating well. I'll not say what I wanted about your face right now. I'm joking, mate!~
@565  = ~What about you, love? Gotta say...I don't like it when you take that much of a beating. But I know you'll be fine.~
@566  = ~You're a bit too hurt for my liking. I'll have to stay closer to you next time, and not just to admire you.~
@567  = ~Me? A story? When do I not, mate?~
@568  = ~Let me tell you the time that I crossed paths with a good ol' chimera. That's right. Fire breathing dragon head. The horned goat head. And the ferocious lion head.~
@569  = ~Okay, go on.~
@570  = ~You are having me on.~
@571  = ~Kale, can you tell something with truth in it?~
@572  = ~Heh, there is truth in it, mate. Just keep listening, eh?~
@573  = ~Now, most folk think you should just watch out for the dragon's head, which can spew fire. But it's the lion you have to watch out for. You forget to pay attention and it snaps your neck.~
@574  = ~I kept my shield up and went in. Hot flames singed and crisped my outer shield but I kept my head down, spinning side to side as it tried to lunge at me with its lion's maw.~
@575  = ~I waited and waited, and moved to the perfect position and then strike! Three heads pierced through with my blade all at once.~
@576  = ~That's impressive.~
@577  = ~That's inconceivable.~
@578  = ~That doesn't sound as difficult for you as I thought it would.~
@579  = ~Heh. What was impressive was the tavern that night. I'll uh, keep that part to myself though.~
@580  = ~Pfft. What, you think my blade wasn't long enough? Trust me, it's plenty long.~
@581  = ~Hey now, I'm a skilled warrior, you know. They just require a bit of tricking. Kind of stupid, Chimeras are, but a fearsome tale.~
@582  = ~I think that was the day I had walked away from Helga and crew. I needed that day. Nothing like facing a bit of danger after learning you lost your father.~
@583  = ~But don't worry about that. I'm fine. I don't need words of comfort. Heh, don't really want them, even. Got to be tough to live, inside and out.~
@584  = ~A story eh? You know I can always deliver the finest tale.~
@585  = ~Let me tell my finest tale. The story where I defeated a wandering wyvern near Gullykin with a slap to the face. You're probably asking how. Well, let me just share the details1~
@586  = ~Kale...~
@587  = ~Okay, this sounds interesting.~
@588  = ~This is already more ridiculous then the last one. And why do your tales always have some sort of scaled creature?~
@589  = ~What?~
@590  = ~Never mind, just go on.~
@591  = ~You can't kill a wyvern by slapping it in the face. And are wyverns even around your village? Can you at least try a semi-believable tale?~
@592  = ~I think I'll take a break from hearing your tales today.~
@593  = ~Pfft. Just wait till you get the details. You'll see how it worked!~
@594  = ~Aww, come on. Well, damn shame. I'll just have to save it for another time.~
@595  = ~Now the most scary thing about a wyvern is its stinging, poisonous tale. Good ol' Kale didn't have anything but a sword in those days, so the goal was to give it a hard swing to take that tail away. Even if it lived, couldn't endanger my folks, eh?~
@596  = ~I waited for it to lunge with its tail, missing just slightly to my right, and moved my sword in for the chop. But it didn't dismember the tail, it just got stuck, left my grip too, damn thing.~
@597  = ~So now it was an unarmed halfling against a really angry wyvern that was staring at me while waving its tail and range, lunging its head forward for some teeth action. I wasn't having none of it.~
@598  = ~I grabbed its face just as its head moved forward, and gave it the biggest slap I could with my hand. Knocked out. Not sure where I came up with the idea, but it was great!~
@599  = ~Very...interesting. Thank you for the story.~
@600  = ~That's silly. It died just from that?~
@601  = ~Now that's humorous! Haha, well done!~
@602  = ~Anytime, anytime! Always my favorite tale to retell.~
@603  = ~I've got rough palms, I've heard. Hard to believe, but I still have that wyvern's head somewhere in Gullykin to show for it. Unless ma threw it out.~
@604  = ~Eh, I could tell you a story. Or we could *make* a story.~
@605  = ~What do you mean?~
@606  = ~Make one? What do you have in mind?~
@607  = ~I really just wanted to hear a story.~
@608  = ~Easier to show you than to tell you.~
@609  = ~Don't take this the wrong way, but you're a bit dense at times, you know that?~
@610  = ~Hey, that's not very nice.~
@611  = ~Oh. You meant...~
@612  = ~I am definitely taking it the "wrong" way. Why would you say that?~
@613  = ~Heh, now you are getting it.~
@614  = ~Sorry, sorry, sheesh. Allow me to make it up to you...~
@615  = ~(He pulls you to him, tugging your hand, pulling you close to giving you a longing kiss.)~
@616  = ~(Kiss him back.)~
@617  = ~Mmm. Let's head to bed and continue there.~
@618  = ~Oh. This is sweet, Kale, but maybe another time.~
@619  = ~Right, right. Damn, I feel rejected. But I bet you'll make the waiting worth while.~
@620  = ~Well! Glory brings fame, which brings opportunity, which brings wealth. I say do some small deeds to get ourselves notices, land ourselves a big gig, and we'll have coin in no time..~
@621  = ~You make it sound a little too easy.~
@622  = ~I guess that is as good a plan as any.~
@623  = ~That doesn't sound like it will be very fast. We need the money swiftly.~
@624  = ~Heh, well, we'll probably have to get a little dirty. But that's what we do, eh?~
@625  = ~Now, if we get a little extra gold, I wouldn't mind spending it on a few luxuries. Nothing we can't afford! Just a few garments to look extra impressive. I'm just kidding! Eh Never mind, I'm not.~
@626  = ~I'd hope so mate, 'tis my plan!~
@627  = ~Well, unless you're the most daring gambler, you don't make money that fast. And let me say it now: Don't gamble.~
@628  = ~That's a good question, mate.~
@629  = ~Well, mate if you trust these thieves, I do. You sure they aren't conning us, though?~
@630  = ~We have to take the risk.~
@631  = ~Do you think it would be any better with the vampires?~
@632  = ~They better not be.~
@633  = ~Heh, you're probably right.~
@634  = ~Well if they are, I've a feeling there isn't much we can do. That's the worrying part, mate.~
@635  = ~I got to say, these vampire are better looking. But damn do they smell. You sure this was the best idea?~
@636  = ~It was them or the shadow thieves. I think they were the better choice~
@637  = ~It better be.~
@638  = ~You're probably right. But it is definitely a risk, mate. Hopefully it pays off.~
@639  = ~I sure hope so. Glad I didn't have to make the choice.~
@640  = ~Well, the sooner we finish doing as they want, the sooner we get to wherever we need to be.~
@641  = ~Heh, seems pretty obvious, doesn't it mate? We came to this island for one reason.~
@642  = ~Yes, I'm after Irenicus.~
@643  = ~To save Imoen.~
@644  = ~It was to enjoy the beach, but it doesn't seem that inviting.~
@645  = ~Well, seems like we should just go find him.~
@646  = ~I hope we'll make it in time. Considering it's a prison...guessing she'll be okay, eh?~
@647  = ~Heh, that is true, mate!~
@648  = ~Oh, I dunno.~
@649  = ~You're soul-less, and need it back. Seems like you're more or less forced to go after Irenicus now.~
@650  = ~He will pay a thousand times for this.~
@651  = ~It is our only path.~
@652  = ~Unfortunately, yes.~
@653  = ~Well, you only got to kill him once. But yes. We'll take him down, mate.~
@654  = ~Shame, really. After all that time in the Underdark, would be nice to take it easy!~
@655  = ~Not fun when destiny pushes you on one path. I would have liked a simpler route, but this mage sure has other plans.~
@656  = ~(You reach out to embrace Kale, and he embraces you in turn, stroking your head gently.)~
@657  = ~(You reach out to squeeze Kale's hand, and he gently squeezes yours in turn.)~
@658  = ~(When you give him an affectionate swap at his hindquarters, he smirks.) Sooo. Someone's feeling touchy today.~
@659  = ~(There's a prickle of shaved hair that tickles your lips when you kiss. A devilish grin forms on Kale's face afterwards.)~
@660  = ~Mmm. No complaints about one of those.~
@661  = ~Heh. Pucker me up anytime.~
@662  = ~(With little warning, Kale tugs you to him, pressing his lips to yours in earnest, before breaking apart for a breath)~
@663  = ~What fool would say no to that?~
@664  = ~(You move together to the inn's baths, where a bath is prepared for you. When you step in, the water is delightfully warm to your skin.)~
@665  = ~Phew. This is relaxation! I wish we had water this warm back in Gullykin.~
@666  = ~You didn't boil your water?~
@667  = ~I'm glad you are enjoying yourself.~
@668  = ~(Pull him close.)~
@669  = ~Well, it took forever. And we halflings always like to move to doing something else. Like eating.~
@670  = ~This is nice. How it should be, you know? Hard work, great reward.~
@671  = ~If we aren't always going to get the recognition, would be nice to get the luxury once in a while.~
@672  = ~It it just the fame that you want, Kale?~
@673  = ~Forget that for a while. Let's enjoy this.~
@674  = ~I recognize you, Kale. And I'm thankful for you.~
@675  = ~It would be nice. But eh, as long as I have you? I'll manage.~
@676  = ~(Your hands wander over each other, cleaning, or sometimes being playful, grinning, laughing, until eventually temptation proves the stronger force.)~
@677  = ~(When you are done, you leave warm, happy, and satisfied, as you move to your room for rest.)~
@678  = ~Damn. I don't know what I did to deserve you, mate.~
@679  = ~(He pecks your cheek in turn, giving you a playful grin.)~
@680  = ~*Yawn*. I'm all tuckered out. We should get some rest.~
@681  = ~You...sure, mate? I'm game if you are but...I just want you to be sure.~
@682  = ~Why wouldn't I be?~
@683  = ~I am if  you are.~
@684  = ~I think I want to wait then, just a little longer.~
@685  = ~I know we haven't done this before but...I'd like to have you stay the night with me. If you don't mind, mate.~
@686  = ~I'd like that. A lot.~
@687  = ~If you are ready, then so am I.~
@688  = ~I don't know if I am ready for that yet, Kale.~
@689  = ~Heh, I'll never say no to that.~
@690  = ~You are mine, <CHARNAME>.~
@691  = ~Always.~
@692  = ~I know what you intend, but perhaps we can just get some rest instead.~
@693  = ~(He tugs you towards his resting place, before undressing you eagerly, giving a small affectionate touch to each new revealed portion of skin.)~
@694  = ~(He then undresses himself, giving you a smug grin.). Shall we get started, then?~
@695  = ~Definitely. But I'll take the lead.~
@696  = ~Yes.~
@697  = ~Er...I don't think I'm ready yet.~
@698  = ~Aww, damn it. Was I moving too fast? Be honest.~
@699  = ~No, it's nothing you did. I just wasn't ready like I thought.~
@700  = ~A little, yes.~
@701  = ~No. I just...I think I'm ready.~
@702  = ~Well, why don't we just cuddle then? We can always get to the good part another time.~
@703  = ~Sure, I'd like that.~
@704  = ~I'd rather sleep alone.~
@705  = ~Say the word, and I'll pause, eh?~
@706  = ~Well then. I'm yours to command.~
@707  = ~(He lets himself fall on his back, ushering you over him. The bliss of joining is terribly satisfying, and urges and needs unknown take over your movements from there.)~
@708  = ~(He lets himself fall on his front, ushering you over him. The bliss of joining is terribly satisfying, and urges and needs unknown take over your movements from there.)~
@709  = ~(When your energy is exhausted, your chest rising and falling after finding sweet release, you feel the comfort of your hand being squeezed, as fatigue draws your body into sleep.)~
@710  = ~You're going to enjoy this, love.~
@711  = ~(You lay down on your back, as he moves towards you. The bliss of joining is terribly satisfying, and urges and needs unknown speak to you in their compelling whispers.)~
@712  = ~(You lay down on your front, as he moves towards you. The bliss of joining is terribly satisfying, and urges and needs unknown speak to you in their compelling whispers.)~
@713  = ~(When Kale's energy is exhausted, both sated as your chest rises and falls, you feel the comfort of your hand being squeezed, fatigue drawing your body to sleep.)~
@714  = ~We could settle in right to bed...or not, if you've got a bit of energy.~
@715  = ~I have some energy. I want you.~
@716  = ~Rest well, mate.~
@717  = ~Just some rest, eh? Or do you think you have some energy?~
@718  = ~I'm always up for some fun.~
@719  = ~We've...never done that before, Kale. But I'd like that.~
@720  = ~I just want to get some rest.~
@721  = ~I am a little nervous. But damn...I'd be a fool to not push through for you.~
@722  = ~Well, why don't we just share a bed, then? I won't do anything funny.~
@723  = ~(You settle in together, cuddling close as weariness pulls you into slumber.)~
@724  = ~Damn...well, good night then, mate.~
@725  = ~(You find Kale drinking a tankard of ale from an inn table.)~
@726  = ~Hey there. Tempted to challenge some of these folk to a drinking 'bout. Easy coin if you pick the right folk.~
@727  = ~You know, I think I could out drink you.~
@728  = ~(His lips taste bitter, the ale he was drinking quite strong.)~
@729  = ~Damn I'm lucky. Now all of these folk will know your are mine.~
@730  = ~Heh, you're on. Let's start with something easy, eh? Dark Ale. Bottoms up.~
@731  = ~(Drink)~
@732  = ~To us.~
@733  = ~Never mind, I forfeit. I want to stay cognitive.~
@734  = ~Sheesh, you're already down after just one drink. We'll have to work on that, heh.~
@735  = ~That's embarrassing.~
@736  = ~I'll win next time.~
@737  = ~How do you even drink something so strong?~
@738  = ~And so close. You look dazed now, heh. Not a bad try, though.~
@739  = ~Heh, I bet it is. But it's nice to outshine you in something for once.~
@740  = ~Heh. You can try. I think I'll enjoy beating you again.~
@741  = ~I'm a natural, eh? Can't give out my secrets.~
@742  = ~Not bad! That's what I usually use to filter out really easy competition. Let me order something stronger...~
@743  = ~There we go. Good ol' Dragon Breath's Beer. You up for the challenge?~
@744  = ~Bring it.~
@745  = ~All right...Damn ,you're good. Well, time to bring out the knocker...~
@746  = ~There it is. Iriaeboran Spirits. This gets anyone. You brave enough?~
@747  = ~Enough talk. Let's drink.~
@748  = ~Bloody hell, you're drinking like it's nothing! I'll have to forfeit. One more and I'll barely be able to stand.~
@749  = ~Well done. Damn, glad I didn't bet coin over this, but I'm not sure what to give you as a reward.~
@750  = ~I have some ideas, if you want to head to our room.~
@751  = ~Just keep serving me well. It's all I want.~
@752  = ~Oh, then you owe me big, then.~
@753  = ~I know, I know. Or I'll just have to win next time.~
@754  = ~Always, mate. Always.~
@755  = ~Ha, I win again!~
@756  = ~(You watch Kale sitting near a tree, eating from a small bowl.)~
@757  = ~Good stuff, eh?~
@758  = ~Mind if I have a bite?~
@759  = ~I'm a bit tired, I'll let you enjoy your meal.~
@760  = ~(You can taste the soup on his lips, slightly sweet. He smirks as you pull away.) You just wanted a taste of my meal, eh?~
@761  = ~Sure! (He hands you his soup bowl for you to taste.)~
@762  = ~How is it?~
@763  = ~Not bad. Who made this?~
@764  = ~A little too sweet.~
@765  = ~Not any better than our rations.~
@766  = ~Heh, Helga. Wish I could cook this well.~
@767  = ~Heh, I might have a shot as a cook then. This is my work. Glad you liked it.~
@768  = ~Heh, Helga hates it when I ask it to be sweetened too. But it makes it bearable, I don't like the ingredients she picks otherwise.~
@769  = ~Well, that's the way I like it. Sorry about that.~
@770  = ~Eh...well...I'll remember that. Damn. There goes my cooking future.~
@771  = ~(Kale finishes his meal, before giving a satisfied sigh.) Good stuff, good stuff.~
@772  = ~You bet. (Kale takes his spoon, and puts it gently towards you to taste.)~
@773  = ~Now, how does it compare to a Kale kiss? Not as sweet, I bet.~
@774  = ~This is way too sweet, actually.~
@775  = ~I might need one to remind myself.~
@776  = ~Nothing can replace your affections.~
@777  = ~I...overdid it with the sweet flavor then. Whoops.~
@778  = ~(He obliges, giving you a peck of his lips.) You better never forget, mate.~
@779  = ~Heh, good. It should stay that way.~
@780  = ~(You find Kale inside his tent, stitching up his cloak.)~
@781  = ~Wish they wouldn't tear it up with their blades. I got to keep this thing looking great.~
@782  = ~I'm a bit tired, I'll let you be.~
@783  = ~(You find Kale in a bedroom, carefully setting his supplies around the room.)~
@784  = ~Nothing like sleeping in an inn during a siege, eh <CHARNAME>?~
@785  = ~Sheesh. This place is like a desert. At least it's cool in here.~
@786  = ~Let's spend the night together.~
@787  = ~You know mate, it's never been less clear. I guess it's whatever your destiny commands. Frustrating, eh?~
@788  = ~A little, yes. It would be nice for some rest.~
@789  = ~Not at all. The adventure goes on.~
@790  = ~Just saying you don't seem to have much of a choice in what direction to go to. Yet the exact direction is...vague. I don't know if I'm making sense. Probably too tired to.~
@791  = ~Wouldn't it? You finally get some recognition and thrown right out into traveling again. What can we do, eh?~
@792  = ~If you're happy mate, I guess it isn't so bad. Guess it can't hurt to add to our accolades.~
@793  = ~Well, we take out all of these other bhaalspawn who, coincidentally, want to kill you.~
@794  = ~Murder begets murder. Doubt there's going to be any way around that.~
@795  = ~I don't think any of them are even redeemable, Kale.~
@796  = ~You're losing the stomach for killing now?~
@797  = ~Unfortunately, no.~
@798  = ~Yeah probably not. And to think a fire giant was one of them. Bhaal really had gotten busy!~
@799  = ~Pfft. Nah. That's not it. Just a bloody path. Gets to your conscience a little. But Never mind me, mate.~
@800  = ~Right? I don't mind killing, lots of it even. But our adventure has had it in more amounts than I've ever heard of. Chilling, almost, the number of monsters I've seen dead around us. Not sure if it's luck or rotten luck, but I'm glad we're still standing.~
@801  = ~(With little warning, Kale tugs you to him, pressing his lips to yours in earnest, before breaking apart for a breathe)~
@802  = ~Let's get some rest together.~
@803  = ~I'd be happy to do that, love.~
@804  = ~Not sure how my cloak keeps surviving every skirmish. But damn does it still look good.~
@805  = ~You move to find Recorder.~
@806  = ~You remember you asked Recorder to spend a bit of time together before you rested.~
@807  = ~(Go see Recorder.)~
@808  = ~(You find Recorder in her room, writing in a thick tome. She doesn't notice you until she finishes and closes it shut.)~
@809  = ~Oh. <CHARNAME>, what do you need?~
@810  = ~(Show Recorder your affections.)~
@811  = ~You look lovely.~
@812  = ~Yes, of course. What do you want to speak of?~
@813  = ~As a bard, you probably have many wonderful stories to share. Can you tell one?~
@814  = ~I was wondering if you could tell another story.~
@815  = ~I was wondering if could tell another story.~
@816  = ~I would not mind doing that for you. Please, make yourself comfortable.~
@817  = ~There was an inspiring performer, a young girl who loved the sounds of the plucked strings of the harp. But it never made the sounds that she heard in inns and taverns.~
@818  = ~Her family too poor to afford lessons, she wandered distraught into the forest, wondering if her destiny was set to be common and unadventurous. While she wept, a little forest pixie heard her weeping and came to flutter beside her.~
@819  = ~"Wipe your eyes, little girl", she said. "I have heard your cries and bring you a gift. Take this key into the tree's hollow. You will find a hole where it fits. Inside shall be a golden harp. Play it everyday, and its magic will make you more skilled. But its magic is broken if you stop the daily routine."~
@820  = ~Overjoyed, the girl thanked the creature profusely, and promised that she would keep true to her directions.~
@821  = ~This sounds almost like a children's tale.~
@822  = ~I was hoping for something more adventurous.~
@823  = ~It is, in a way. One of my favorites.~
@824  = ~I am sorry. I will tell something like that next time.~
@825  = ~Over the years, she kept to the fey's direction. Soon she mastered little harmonies and melodies, but her work never quite matched even the novice local performers that would visit the taverns. Her father had passed away and the family income was now the responsibility of her mother, who found her daughter's hobby unhelpful to the new burden.~
@826  = ~Her friends made fun of her for being cooped up in her tree for so long, and one day, frustrated by her music's to match the serene perfection of the great performers she heard, she dropped the harp on the ground and curled into the corner, distraught.~
@827  = ~The pixie visited her that night, and told her "I will take back the gift, if it so displeases you.". But the young girl, with time having passed to ease her pain, pleaded for her to keep it, for another chance. The pixie granted this, and another gift, a small ring, which shimmered a silver light, and was engraved with the word 'belief'.~
@828  = ~"This is from my sister". Wear it, and the magic will be all the stronger.~
@829  = ~She always wore the ring after that, even to the day she disappeared from the village altogether, no longer needing the old gifted harp. Her music had become angelic, and people from all around invited her to play. Fame and riches came to her, as well as suitors, but she had never thanked the creature.~
@830  = ~One day in her dreams, she saw the pixie again. She exclaimed her thanks, but distressed she had no gift worthy to give her. So she asked her name, so she could immortalize it in song.~
@831  = ~'My name', the creature said, 'is persistence'.~
@832  = ~That was a beautiful story.~
@833  = ~That was a rather long tale.~
@834  = ~Was anything in that story really magic?~
@835  = ~Thank you. It is a story I shared once with someone special. And you are special, so I thought it would be fitting if you heard it.~
@836  = ~It could be, but it doesn't have to, either. Faith and perseverance are real forces. We can conjure up this magic with our minds, but it takes much discipline to truly retain their power.~
@837  = ~I am sorry. It is a bit of a longer tale, but I thought since there was time, it would work. I will keep brevity in mind next time.~
@838  = ~I would love to. Perhaps I can tell you of another early adventure. Before I met you. Before I even crossed the border from Amn to Baldur's Gate.~
@839  = ~I had left Althkata to make my way to a local town where a caravan would make a route north. There were caravans like that in Althkata, but they were expensive, and some were a bit suspicious.~
@840  = ~I had rested near a cave, thinking it free of anything, when this enormous swarm of dire rats came bustling out. Alone they aren't too worrisome, a crossbow bolt usually scares them off, but in a swarm they could take down a grown gnome like myself.~
@841  = ~Did you run?~
@842  = ~Did you fight?~
@843  = ~I did run a little, and fired at whatever got too close.~
@844  = ~They were getting closer and closer, and one of them had managed to nip through my dress. Then Gustav jumped out of my pack and hissed at all of them, standing his ground.~
@845  = ~I couldn't believe it. They had the numbers. They could either swarm or back off...and somehow Gustav's cry was intimidating enough they all went back into the cave.~
@846  = ~I always knew from that day on we would protect each other. Although I still hate it when he does something so foolish like that.~
@847  = ~You have a good pet, Recorder.~
@848  = ~I'm surprised you just let him do that.~
@849  = ~Thank you for the tale.~
@850  = ~More than a pet. A true friend.~
@851  = ~I wanted to scoop him up. But they way he just acted...something told me to trust him. I'm glad I did.~
@852  = ~Anytime you wish, <CHARNAME>. I am glad to share stories, even if they are about myself like this.~
@853  = ~I did fight back a little, and made movement away from the cave whenever it was safe to take steps away.~
@854  = ~Another one? Well...I guess I could tell you of my trip from Brynnlaw to Amn.~
@855  = ~I believe I told you in the past I was put in a barrel. It was difficult to breathe, it was stuffed with fish of all things.~
@856  = ~I guess it was a free bit of sustenance, but it was a high risk to go anywhere while on board.~
@857  = ~That sounds highly uncomfortable.~
@858  = ~This was after you thought you had killed your son?~
@859  = ~How did you endure?~
@860  = ~It was...I remember just being in misery. But life before then had been terrible. It was endure or die.~
@861  = ~I ate what I needed, and slept when I could. Sleeping made time go faster. And sometimes, when it was quiet, I would test the lid of the barrel, but only will kept me from looking around.~
@862  = ~In some ways...I did want to die then. Raban should have been with me, but he wasn't. The only thing that gave me any sense of hope was in Amn, was a temple of Oghma, and with it, a way to my mother.~
@863  = ~I didn't leave the fish barrel until they opened it themselves, a fishing merchant. It was terrifying to be in someone else's mercy, especially as I had eaten what I had to live. The Temple of Oghma was but steps away, just at Althkata's docks, and he could have given me to the guards or worse, back to Brynnlaw.~
@864  = ~I will never forget his kindness. He let me go, with a promise that he would stop by the temple later to see if my story was true. He got some clothes from his wife for me, a bit large, but...fitting enough. Mine smelled like fish and were wet.~
@865  = ~They healed me at the temple, and eventually got word to my mother. She paid the fisherman very well at my request. If it was another one, I may never have been here.~
@866  = ~I  know this is a weird story to tell. It's not heroic just...about enduring and surviving.~
@867  = ~I was curious how you made it to Amn in one piece. I found it interesting.~
@868  = ~Think nothing of it.~
@869  = ~Just make your next one more exciting.~
@870  = ~I am glad then. I found it embarrassing to think about. But being in the hands of others...I think there is a true fear in that. When all you can do is plead with your eyes, and try to speak with only your body.~
@871  = ~I will try on your behalf. It is just something that surfaced on my mind.~
@872  = ~I am faring just fine, <CHARNAME>.~
@873  = ~I am doing well, my love. Gustav is too.~
@874  = ~I am in one piece. Thank you for checking on me.~
@875  = ~With you around, my love, I am strong.~
@876  = ~A little injured. Some rest will help.~
@877  = ~It hurts...but I am glad to be alive by your side.~
@878  = ~I am in some pain, my love. But with you here, it is a little better.~
@879  = ~Injured, but still standing. It could be worse.~
@880  = ~You look to be okay, <CHARNAME>. That makes me glad.~
@881  = ~You seem to be strong as ever. Inspiring.~
@882  = ~You seem to be okay, my love. That makes me glad.~
@883  = ~You seem to be as strong as ever, darling. That makes me happy.~
@884  = ~I hope you get some rest. Your injuries look painful.~
@885  = ~Are you all right though? I can see some of the wounds you've sustained. They look worrying, but I know you'll say you'll endure.~
@886  = ~I hope you don't mind if I look over your wounds. I can't heal them, I just want to make sure they're not threatening...Hrm. I suppose they seem fine.~
@887  = ~You are hurt, my love. You don't need to hide it. I'd rather know than always wonder. Some rest will do you good.~
@888  = ~Hrm. The problem ahead is to gather money for a group you are not even sure of, is that correct?~
@889  = ~More or less correct.~
@890  = ~I can't think of any other path.~
@891  = ~Them, or anyone else who can assist us.~
@892  = ~I would try to listen for people who ask for help. Many offer monetary reward, because their troubles are a bit too significant for simple volunteer work.~
@893  = ~Find them, and then assist as many as you can. I am sure given enough time, we can have enough gold.~
@894  = ~We just have to be mindful of what we spend: Spend too little, and we may be underequipped. Spend too much, and it will take us a long time. That is my advice.~
@895  = ~You ask a difficult question, <CHARNAME>.~
@896  = ~The Shadow Thieves are always looking for opportunity, and we could just be their pawns. But I do not see much of another option. Do you trust them?~
@897  = ~I have no choice.~
@898  = ~I do.~
@899  = ~They'll regret it if they cross me.~
@900  = ~That is what I see, too. We have to have faith, and perhaps the path will prove true.~
@901  = ~I would hold onto that, then. Have faith, and the path will prove true.~
@902  = ~I don't know, I do not think they intend to cross us. Perhaps use us, but I have faith they will prove true.~
@903  = ~To work with vampires, undead and evil must have been a very difficult decision...do you trust them?~
@904  = ~We did have a choice. But I wonder if the other one is truly any better. I hope the path at the end has a light.~
@905  = ~I am less sure. I do not trust them, but I will still walk with you~
@906  = ~They would, though I wonder if that is their plan all along. We can only move forward and see.~
@907  = ~I'm not the best person to ask. I...really want out of here.~
@908  = ~We'll not be here long.~
@909  = ~Be strong, Recorder.~
@910  = ~Just answer my question.~
@911  = ~Thank you...I wished I could give proper advice but...~
@912  = ~That is the right thing to do. But it is far, far too difficult to accomplish.~
@913  = ~I'm sorry. That is all I can suggest...that we leave quickly.~
@914  = ~Irenicus seems to be forming the path for you. No matter how many walls are in your way, it is climbing and climbing until he is before us.~
@915  = ~I will have my revenge.~
@916  = ~We will make it past them all.~
@917  = ~Do you expect more such obstacles?~
@918  = ~You scare me when you say that but...with what he did to you, I can think of no reason why anyone shouldn't seek revenge.~
@919  = ~Your faith inspires me. I truly believe we  can survive, and last long enough that you can get your soul back in time.~
@920  = ~Many. But I do believe that we can get through each of them. We have to.~
@921  = ~Oh, thank you. You look um, nice, too, despite the day's affairs.~
@922  = ~Did you want to talk?~
@923  = ~(You reach out to embrace Recorder, and she leans into your touch welcomingly.)~
@924  = ~(You stroke Recorder's cheek, and she leans into your touch with a content sigh.)~
@925  = ~(You reach forward to grasp her hand, slightly cool to the touch. Her fingers grasp around it and squeeze back.)~
@926  = ~(A smile forms on her lips as you kiss her. She gives a longing sigh when you pull away.)~
@927  = ~Heehee. I love you too.~
@928  = ~Mmm. This was nice.~
@929  = ~(Recorder pulls you to her, and you find her lips on yours, warm, slow pecks.)~
@930  = ~Stay and talk to me for a while? I enjoy your presence dearly.~
@931  = ~I'd love to, <CHARNAME>.~
@932  = ~(You and Recorder embark together to the inn's baths, where an attendant prepares warm water before giving you privacy.)~
@933  = ~*Sigh*. This is so relaxing. I didn't realize how sore I was.~
@934  = ~Would you like a massage?~
@935  = ~I thought you might like this.~
@936  = ~(Pull her close.)~
@937  = ~That sounds nice. Please, go ahead.~
@938  = ~(She turns with her back facing and allows you to move your hands to relieve her back.)~
@939  = ~(Continue the massage.)~
@940  = ~(Let your hands wander playfully.)~
@941  = ~Definitely. This is...utterly relaxing.~
@942  = ~(She sets her head to your side, closing her eyes.)~
@943  = ~(Massage her back.)~
@944  = ~(For a while you massage her back, moving her hands to soothe tense muscle and sores, while cleaning with the water. She turns and gives you a thankful peck of her lips when you are done.)~
@945  = ~I am lucky to have you, <CHARNAME>. You have no idea.~
@946  = ~And I you.~
@947  = ~Quite lucky, I'd say.~
@948  = ~Perhaps you can return the favor?~
@949  = ~(She twirls a finger, gesturing for you to turn around as she now massages and cleans you. The water grows slightly cold when all is done, and you return to your room to rest together.)~
@950  = ~Quite? Maybe I am. It is your turn now, I believe.~
@951  = ~What are yo- oh. Is that what you want, then?~
@952  = ~(She laughs and pulls you to her, kissing, sighing, and exhaling in bliss given and taken. The water grows cold when all is done, and you return to your room to rest together.)~
@953  = ~I desire you so much. Join me, please.~
@954  = ~I'd love to, normally. But let's just get some rest.~
@955  = ~Gladly, my love.~
@956  = ~If that is your wish.~
@957  = ~Not today, Recorder. I want to take this slow.~
@958  = ~To rest, then. But...I desire you, <CHARNAME>, and if you wanted to, well...~
@959  = ~Are you sure about this?~
@960  = ~Of course, Recorder. Come here.~
@961  = ~Can you still stay with me? I want to feel you beside me, if that is all right.~
@962  = ~That I would like a lot.~
@963  = ~Oh...have a good rest, then.~
@964  = ~I understand. Hold me close. It makes me feel safe.~
@965  = ~(You fall together in your resting place, Recorder leaning against you all the while as your eyes drift into rest and dreams.)~
@966  = ~That sounds lovely, <CHARNAME>. I would be glad to.~
@967  = ~Very sure, <CHARNAME>. I cannot think of a more worthy <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@968  = ~(She guides you to her resting place, before moving her fingers to undo your clothing. She gives you a long, yearning kiss, sweet and slow, before stepping away to undo her own clothes.)~
@969  = ~(She slows down, as if hesitating, before slipping off her tunic. A hand covers what is a noticeable scar on her abdomen.)~
@970  = ~I'm sorry. I don't know why I am so...nervous suddenly. It's nothing.~
@971  = ~How did you get it?~
@972  = ~Don't hide it. You are all beautiful.~
@973  = ~Phelgrim. In a different time, when I was younger and prettier but...not truly in love. This is silly. I love you. And...you love me. I want this.~
@974  = ~I want this too.~
@975  = ~Maybe we should wait. You don't need to force something you are uncomfortable with.~
@976  = ~I don't think I can see this everyday, I'm sorry.~
@977  = ~I...I am glad you told me that now. (She turns away from you, clearly embarrassed, as she puts her clothes on.) Please leave...I'm sorry for...I don't even know. Just leave me alone.)~
@978  = ~Oh, you make me blush. You are a blessing from Garl. I just feel it.~
@979  = ~You are very sweet, <CHARNAME>. But I will be fine. I promise you.~
@980  = ~(She lays herself down, letting you take the lead, guiding you to her mouth for more slow, sweet yearning kisses. Her fingers graze into your hair as she sighs.)~
@981  = ~(She guides your fingers across herself, before beckoning you into her. You join with a slow, sweet passion, a slow, growing wave, that eventually builds into a full momentum before crashing down from a blissful high.)~
@982  = ~(She guides your fingers across herself, before beckoning one of them into her. You watch your tender loving grow into a wave, that eventually builds into a full momentum before it comes crashing down from a blissful high.)~
@983  = ~(When you are done, you find her panting, and glowingly happy. She pulls you to her side and leans her head against yours. Soon the call of sleep takes you both into slumber.)~
@984  = ~Have a good rest <CHARNAME>.~
@985  = ~(You find Recorder writing into her tome, notes sprawled out on a table.)~
@986  = ~It is so hard to keep track of everything. I'm glad we stopped in an inn, the lighting makes it easier to write.~
@987  = ~How goes your records?~
@988  = ~I'm a bit tired, I'll leave you to your writing.~
@989  = ~(She allows you a peck, before shifting back to focus on her work.)~
@990  = ~You are distracting, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate your affections dearly though.~
@991  = ~Well, actually. Would you mind if I asked you a question while you are here? This is for the records.~
@992  = ~Certainly.~
@993  = ~If you want to.~
@994  = ~A little. I'd rather not be interviewed right now.~
@995  = ~I understand. I will let you be then, <CHARNAME>. Have a good rest.~
@996  = ~Do you find it difficult to retain your beliefs and ideologies on things as you have traveled? I imagine when a situation reveals itself, how you are taught might be difficult to apply to what is happening.~
@997  = ~I don't actually. I stand by everything Gorion taught me to this day.~
@998  = ~I've had to make compromises, yes. Sometimes it is a matter of choosing what is the least evil when there are no good choices.~
@999  = ~I've not cared about any of that. Such things only hold you back.~
@1000 = ~He would be proud of you for trying. I didn't know him well. But I do believe that.~
@1001 = ~That must be a bit frustrating. But I believe if you keep trying, you may find you do not have to sacrifice good things to do necessary things.~
@1002 = ~I can...understand why someone may come to that mindset. It isn't one I share, but it isn't one I can find fault with either.~
@1003 = ~I think readers will like being able to see a little bit more of your thinking from your own words. If I ever live to see this published.~
@1004 = ~You will. I promise.~
@1005 = ~I am sure I can finish writing it for you if you do.~
@1006 = ~There are plenty of others who have witnessed my travels, I am sure.~
@1007 = ~You always just have this way of inspiring people. I really enjoy that.~
@1008 = ~Um...while you could do that, it would make it more of an autobiography. I suppose it could be interesting.~
@1009 = ~I hope not. Not that I mind others contributing! I just...Never mind, I am just being silly again.~
@1010 = ~Well! Though I think another question has formed on my mind, if you don't mind me asking.~
@1011 = ~Why do you adventure, <CHARNAME>?~
@1012 = ~Honestly, I've felt more forced to the road than anything else.~
@1013 = ~I want to make lives better. Make the world a better place.~
@1014 = ~For the fame and glory. I want to be remembered.~
@1015 = ~I want to show how strong I am, and become even more powerful.~
@1016 = ~I just want to be rich, really.~
@1017 = ~I'd rather not say.~
@1018 = ~From a sort of destiny call? Knowing who you are...I can understand where that answer comes from. I think it suits you, though I do believe you have some crafting of your own road. You are not entirely beholden to fate. But maybe I'm just being quirky.~
@1019 = ~That is a beautiful thing to do. There is so much suffering and trauma in the world. Just a single soul doing even something small can cause a beautiful ripple that inspires.~
@1020 = ~I understand. Many adventurers wish to carve something out for themselves. To leave their mark on the world, so that they feel their lives have a purpose.~
@1021 = ~For power? Knowledge and power can be a worthy pursuit if tempered with caution and wisdom. Not that you have done poorly. I hope I do not come across like I am judging.~
@1022 = ~Just...riches? I suppose it is one path to take. Quicker, if also deadlier.~
@1023 = ~Thank you for your answer. It gives me more understanding of you, or at least how you see yourself. Even if it turned out to be something different than what I thought, I think people's self-perceptions can be interesting to someone reading about you.~
@1024 = ~Oh, I had no idea how late it was getting. We should get some rest.~
@1025 = ~(You watch Recorder sitting near the fire, playing a tune from her flute. She pauses for a moment at your approach.)~
@1026 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>.~
@1027 = ~Could you teach me to play?~
@1028 = ~I'm a bit tired, I'll leave you to your playing.~
@1029 = ~Mmm. I enjoy your little bits of affection a lot, <CHARNAME>.~
@1030 = ~I would be glad to. I'll give you my flute to play. We could start with something simple, like form and playing a note, or a few scales, or maybe even a full tune.~
@1031 = ~Teach me about form and posture.~
@1032 = ~Let me practice a few scales.~
@1033 = ~I'd like to play a song.~
@1034 = ~Very well. Extend your arm out, form your lips like a diamond, put your fingers into this position, and blow your air gently. Give it a stream of your breath.~
@1035 = ~(Play a note.)~
@1036 = ~Oh...um...that's not quite it. Do you want to try again?~
@1037 = ~(Play a note again.)~
@1038 = ~Ah, this may not be for me. I'll let you keep playing.~
@1039 = ~That was wonderful. Would you like to try to play a scale?~
@1040 = ~Maybe some other time. I'll let you keep playing.~
@1041 = ~Let me demonstrate you the positions first. Fingers here...and fingers here, move them just like this, one hole open at a time, and then reverse it, covering them down, until you're back to the first note.~
@1042 = ~Now, give it a try.~
@1043 = ~(Play the scale.)~
@1044 = ~Um, that was close. Maybe just a little more practice. Let me demonstrate my positions, and then try again.~
@1045 = ~(Play the scale again.)~
@1046 = ~Beautiful. You are learning faster than I did. Would you like to try to play a song? I can teach you something simple.~
@1047 = ~I'm up for the challenge.~
@1048 = ~Let me play it first. Watch my positions carefully. I'll demonstrate them to you...I'm playing a little slowly so you can catch it.~
@1049 = ~Okay. Let's have you give it a try, <CHARNAME>. It's okay if you aren't perfect. I hope I wasn't going too fast.~
@1050 = ~(Play the song back.)~
@1051 = ~You made a lot of errors on your song. Do you want to try one more time?~
@1052 = ~(Play the song again.)~
@1053 = ~That was beautiful. You may be a savant of sorts.~
@1054 = ~All thanks to my amazing teacher.~
@1055 = ~Thanks, Recorder.~
@1056 = ~This is quite easy.~
@1057 = ~You'll make me blush. It was more the student. But you have my thanks.~
@1058 = ~You are welcome, <CHARNAME>. It was a pleasure to share the gift of music with you.~
@1059 = ~There are so many songs I could show you sometime. We could maybe even play a duet sometime. That would be wonderful.~
@1060 = ~I'm going to retire for the night.~
@1061 = ~Have a pleasant rest, <CHARNAME>.~
@1062 = ~Would you...join me?~
@1063 = ~Still not quite it, but maybe after some rest, we can get it down some other time.~
@1064 = ~We can try some more some other time. I will try to be a better teacher, then.~
@1065 = ~Let me know if you are interested in learning some more again.~
@1066 = ~I will let you get some rest. Oghma's blessings to you.~
@1067 = ~(You find Recorder inside her tent, kneeling down to give her ferret Gustav a meal.)~
@1068 = ~Oh, hello <CHARNAME>. Just feeding Gustav before I fall asleep.~
@1069 = ~(You find Recorder in a bedroom, carefully safeguarding her tome into her pack.)~
@1070 = ~I hope nothing is destroyed in the night. I would hate to lose everything.~
@1071 = ~My tome is almost full. Our travels have truly been long.~
@1072 = ~I think our first objective is to get a grasp of the situation. The more we understand, the more sound decisions we can make.~
@1073 = ~That sounds like good advice.~
@1074 = ~Nothing more specific to suggest?~
@1075 = ~So far, I'm only getting more questions than answers.~
@1076 = ~I hope so. I am not sure how to help further, I am sure the route will eventually become clearer to us as we learn more information.~
@1077 = ~I am sorry, but I do not. I am sure as we gather knowledge, the route will be revealed to us.~
@1078 = ~It may take time for things to be clearer, but...I am sure as we gather knowledge, the route will be revealed to us.~
@1079 = ~We are fighting a war, almost, over your destiny.~
@1080 = ~Each of these bhaalspawn enemies are going to be different, and strong. But like the giant, they are bound to have something we can use to defeat them.~
@1081 = ~That is a good thought, Recorder.~
@1082 = ~If only things were simpler like they used to be.~
@1083 = ~None of them can best our might.~
@1084 = ~All power can be defeated. They may think they are gods, or close to one, but that pride could be their downfall, as long as you don't gain the hubris yourself.~
@1085 = ~Heehee, I am not sure I would ever call your adventures simple. But the stakes have never seemed higher.~
@1086 = ~Our might is strong, <CHARNAME>. But beware the hubris of pride. As it was others undoing, so it could be our own.~
@1087 = ~You move to find Vienxay.~
@1088 = ~You remember you asked Vienxay to spend a bit of time together before you rested.~
@1089 = ~(Go see Vienxay.)~
@1090 = ~(You find Vienxay in her room, boredly making a weapon disappear and then appear in her hand.)~
@1091 = ~I assume you want my company.~
@1092 = ~Show Vienxay your affections.~
@1093 = ~Have I told you how attractive you are?~
@1094 = ~I'd like to make love with you.~
@1095 = ~I suppose so.~
@1096 = ~How are you faring?~
@1097 = ~I was wondering if you had any stories you could tell me of yourself.~
@1098 = ~Do you have any advice to give about our path?~
@1099 = ~Actually, let's get some rest.~
@1100 = ~Actually. I'm going to go get some rest.~
@1101 = ~Hrmph. As you wish. Perhaps I can tell you what it was like to be forced from Evermeet. It comes to my mind almost everyday.~
@1102 = ~My sisters were the only ones to see me off that day. To be bound by rope was humiliating. They were not allowed to come close to me, and so I could only turn and say farewell with my eyes.~
@1103 = ~Then I was bound into the lower deck of the ship until we crossed the ocean. No sight of the beautiful sun or the sky. Just slop for food and tasteless water.~
@1104 = ~In fairness, you were a criminal.~
@1105 = ~That must have been hard.~
@1106 = ~Yes, yes, I know. No need to point it out.~
@1107 = ~Of course it was. And yet it was deserved, and I could hardly argue it, even if I had claimed innocence to the end.~
@1108 = ~On my final day of traveling, before they would release me off of the dock, they had a magi go down and meet with me, along with one of the priests of Correlon.~
@1109 = ~That was the most painful day of my life. They made condolences, and apologies, but insisted it must be done: The Mark.~
@1110 = ~The mark?~
@1111 = ~That doesn't sound good.~
@1112 = ~Doesn't seem like they were sorry.~
@1113 = ~That is what you see upon my forehead. This one means: Exile: Kinslayer. I do not think any outside of Evermeet would know that, but the few of our kind who I have met who have left and known what it means have often resulted in a shameful meeting.~
@1114 = ~It was as if my head burned when it was applied. I screamed and cried but the pain never lessened until they were done.~
@1115 = ~It cannot be dispelled. It cannot be wiped away. It is with me, always, and forever.~
@1116 = ~Sometimes, I wondered how I did not give in to the urge to escape the ship at all.~
@1117 = ~How would you even have escaped?~
@1118 = ~I am glad you did not.~
@1119 = ~You should have. At the very least, your life would have been in your hands.~
@1120 = ~The Shadowplane is very close to our own, only a leap away, that which I was capable of. But there are kin of mine who know that secret, and I could have been found. Even if I wasn't followed...it is a dangerous place.~
@1121 = ~It is perhaps something I can divulge another time. We have spoken long enough.~
@1122 = ~As am I, in the end. It would have brought only more ill.~
@1123 = ~I have thought this on some days. But at worst, I may have only taken more lives in cost of that freedom, and brought only more shame. If they were humans, perhaps. But they were kin, family.~
@1124 = ~It isn't good at all. It means that I am marked and forever identified in shame.~
@1125 = ~Sorry? Not in the sense you understand. More like pitied. And I hated every minute of it.~
@1126 = ~I suppose I could tell you a little more of what I spoke of before, the plane of Shadow.~
@1127 = ~I could have tried to escape, you see, and stayed on Evermeet. When I first landed, the prison ship leaving me on this foreign soil with only my clothes and enough to perhaps afford a tenday's worth of rent in a tavern, I fell to that temptation, to try to return via Shadowplane.~
@1128 = ~I had wondered why our enemies never used such a path to get there when I began, as it seemed so simple and brilliant, and then I understood.~
@1129 = ~You were going to risk breaking your own exile?~
@1130 = ~What did you come to find out?~
@1131 = ~Why not try this earlier?~
@1132 = ~Yes. To truly...truly comprehend that you were alone, seperated from your people. It was too much.~
@1133 = ~Perhaps because it had not set in. You pray that perhaps the gods my have mercy, that they would turn around and give you a second chance, or that my false pleas of innocence would have been heard.~
@1134 = ~When I stepped into the plane of shadow, I saw the coast as a twisted version of the coast I had just seen. Often it is a reflection of what the land you were just in was, sometimes older. Time moves slower in the Shadowplane. You could be lost for years and return only to find a few months have passed.~
@1135 = ~It is why I am able to move so quickly to an enemy in battle: the differences in time give me an enormous advantage of placement. It is all just about remembering where to go, since they are not in the shadow plane themselves.~
@1136 = ~There were hideous monsters, canines that looked like worgs, flaming horses that you might call nightmares, and skull helmed warriors marching across into some distant forest.~
@1137 = ~A few of these dog-like creatures had picked up on my presence. Perhaps they had sensed my fear or unease, but they were slowly trekking my direction. And if you cannot make out shades and shadows in the Shadowplane, you are easy prey.~
@1138 = ~What did you do?~
@1139 = ~You were afraid?~
@1140 = ~I'm guessing you abandoned your plan?~
@1141 = ~Yes. Understandbly, who wouldn't? I had no idea the land looked like this here. I left...and kept my visits extremely brief since.~
@1142 = ~Yes. As soon as I saw one of the canines leap, I left. I could still see a bit of blood from a defensive thrust of my dagger drip from the blade. I was still new to my shadow magic powers then...it was a reminder that I had so much more to learn.~
@1143 = ~I never tried to return to Evermeet again. My only choice was to continue on this land.~
@1144 = ~That's what it is for all of us here.~
@1145 = ~What was your first bit of travels like on the mainland?~
@1146 = ~I'm impressed you can travel from plane to plane so easily.~
@1147 = ~Yes, I know. Perhaps I should not whine so much, hrmph. But I do miss Evermeet.~
@1148 = ~Another time. We have talked much.~
@1149 = ~For a beginner...it was impressive. Even my old mentor found my ease of travel quite astonishing. But all planar travelers know that the different planes are extremely dangerous. And I knew still knew so little of the shadow plane.~
@1150 = ~Yes, I suppose I can continue where the last one was, and finish this series of my beginnings and how I adjusted to living on the mainland.~
@1151 = ~I told you I had about a tenday's worth of income to live on. That quickly ran out once I got to the nearest town. I wasn't stupid, but even if I budgeted it, I would need to find work quickly.~
@1152 = ~Unfortunately I had no luck finding work. The innkeeper found me unsuitable for some reason, and any other human I asked told me to go away. I could barely bear asking them at all.~
@1153 = ~Somehow I'm not surprised.~
@1154 = ~I am guessing you were rude to them.~
@1155 = ~What did you do for money, then?~
@1156 = ~Please, it was nothing I did. Besides, this was my first...encounter alone with these people. It was...difficult for me.~
@1157 = ~With employment not an option, I resorted to stealing. And the prime option was a church of Red Knight, where sodliers or common people throw their wealth praying that their plans go well.~
@1158 = ~You stole from a church? Surprising.~
@1159 = ~That is a good place for a theft.~
@1160 = ~Were you successful?~
@1161 = ~I was desperate, and I did not want to starve. Do not judge me.~
@1162 = ~I had entered into the main chambers, were a temple guard was sleeping. I had just gotten enough for a month perhaps, when the man stirred.~

@1165 = ~Soon I was out of throwing weapons, I had very few as they only allowed me a few weapons when I left for my survival, and a dagger was no match for the reach of his sword. I thought I was dead. That is when I returned to the shadow plane to avoid what would have been a lethal slash.~
@1166 = ~I must repeat that one should not linger in the Shadowplane long, and so I moved only far enough to appear near the door. Then I ran for my life.~
@1167 = ~I was well out of town, found what appeared to be an abandoned barn, and fell asleep.~
@1168 = ~Clever of you.~
@1169 = ~That's it, then?~
@1170 = ~Where did you go from here?~
@1171 = ~So I thought as well.~
@1172 = ~Unfortunately not.~
@1173 = ~I did not quite get away. I awoke to a blade in my face. The damn guard had tracked me down.~
@1174 = ~He complimented me on my tactics, and left me with only a portion of what I had taken. He warned me to never do it again, or it would be my life.~
@1175 = ~He said he only spared me because I was taking to survive, and he had heard of my failed attempts to find work. It was a strange kindness, one that I would never quite understand.~
@1176 = ~After all this time, you still do not understand?~
@1177 = ~Thank you for the tale, Vienxay.~
@1178 = ~I see your adjustment to being poor went quite poorly.~
@1179 = ~I do now. It took me a while to understand kindness and consideration of another's needs and desire to live. It is a lesson I won't forget.~
@1180 = ~Hardly. He could have gotten away with murder. It made no sense, and it still doesn't. But I will say that I will remember it if the situation is ever reversed.~
@1181 = ~Yes, yes. I was more experienced after that. Nothing eventful beyond learning of my mentor's return. But those are tales you are likely familiar with.~
@1182 = ~Ugh, with that awful pun I will declare this tale-telling over.~
@1183 = ~Please, I am obviously fine, <CHARNAME>.~
@1184 = ~You fret too much. Your beloved is no flower.~
@1185 = ~I am hardly easy to injure. See? My skin is flawless.~
@1186 = ~Ugh, you coddle me too much. But I love you for it, I suppose.~
@1187 = ~I would appreciate some potion or healing. Do keep that in mind.~
@1188 = ~You do like to ask the obvious, I am in pain. And not the sort you can kiss better, so don't even think about it.~
@1189 = ~Ugh...I could use some tender healing. I am sure you don't want your dearly beloved elf to perish.~
@1190 = ~My skin is scratched! I better not get scars from this.~
@1191 = ~You seem all right. I suppose that's good.~
@1192 = ~I guess you are faring well. Hrmph.~
@1193 = ~Just keep yourself in healthy condition. I'll not be with a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who is helpless. Oh fine, I'm kidding. Still. Keep yourself well.~
@1194 = ~You seem to be faring very well. Your indisputable strength is attractive.~
@1195 = ~Might I say you look awful? More awful than usual. Don't look at me like that, just find time to tend yourself.~
@1196 = ~But please, stop worrying about me and look at yourself, will you? If you fall over and die we will have no group leader.~
@1197 = ~I'll not be with a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who is limping or hopeless. I'm joking, obviously. Still. Tend to yourself soon.~
@1198 = ~But here you are fretting about me when you are in pain. I'll not lose our group leader and my lover, take care of yourself soon.~
@1199 = ~I think it is simple. If you can't work the gold, steal it. There are so many humans who hardly need it, and plenty of large houses for the taking.~
@1200 = ~I want to get the gold right, Vienxay.~
@1201 = ~I guess if it gets bad, we can consider that.~
@1202 = ~You have a point. There are plenty of buildings to loot from.~
@1203 = ~Just understand "right" takes more time, isn't as thrilling, and is perhaps more lethal. I am a reliable source of income...but if you insist, the decision is yours.~
@1204 = ~I would hope you would. My advice I imagine, is golden. I have robbed quite fine and not been caught. It is only other people arguing with me that ever gets me in jail.~
@1205 = ~Whatever you do, be mindful who you pay with all of it. Not everyone can be trusted.~
@1206 = ~Hrmph. I cannot fault you for seeking advice about this.~
@1207 = ~The Shadow Thieves. I hate their name. They hardly know anything about shadow magic, but they do seem our best bet. So far, they've seemed...reasonable.~
@1208 = ~Jealous of their name?~
@1209 = ~So far. I hope it remains that way.~
@1210 = ~If they are just taking our money for nothing, they will feel my wrath.~
@1211 = ~Hardly. Hardly at all. I just find it insulting.~
@1212 = ~I suppose all there is to do is wait and see. I think you made the best decision you could, given the options.~
@1213 = ~As you should feel. They feel difficult to trust, but as I said, they have been reasonable.~
@1214 = ~It is an interesting arrangement, even if I am not fond of the dead, this is a promise to get to where we need to be.~
@1215 = ~I thought you wouldn't mind undead.~
@1216 = ~You did sound approving of this direction.~
@1217 = ~This was the best decision. It was them or the Shadow Thieves.~
@1218 = ~They smell. Of course I mind undead. But if this is what it takes to get what we need, then the end goal justifies it all.~
@1219 = ~Of course. I didn't like these humans much. But do not mistake me, I am not much more fond of who we work for either.~
@1220 = ~Hrmph, perhaps. Time will tell all.~
@1221 = ~It's obvious. Track down Irenicus. Kill him, and let us be done with it.~
@1222 = ~It won't be that simple.~
@1223 = ~Aye. He owes me.~
@1224 = ~There are still many questions I have for him.~
@1225 = ~Of course not. But you have me, and so we have a chance.~
@1226 = ~Good. Revenge is sweet...and this one I think will hardly leave you hollow. The wise think revenge solves nothing. I say they are fools.~
@1227 = ~I think the answers are hardly worth it. Find and kill him. Do not let him escape.~
@1228 = ~We help my people. Even if they seem distrusting of us, it is for good reason.~
@1229 = ~They aren't really your people though.~
@1230 = ~My target is Irenicus. They are wasting my time.~
@1231 = ~I suppose that is the only choice right now.~
@1232 = ~They may not be of Evermeet, but they are my kin. And...they have suffered as well. They are owed vengeance for that.~
@1233 = ~They are distrusting, but so would Evermeet be in their situation. You are an outsider. Earn their trust, and I am sure things will open up.~
@1234 = ~Your path has hardly been one where the other choices have been better. A fool would run and hide. You are greater then that, even if I feel you should run sometimes. You can do this.~
@1235 = ~You have now, and perhaps before. But I enjoy hearing it.~
@1236 = ~I imagine you wished to talk of something, with such a compliment thrown out, however.~
@1237 = ~(You reach out to hold Vienxay's hand. She rolls her eyes, but she doesn't detach herself.)~
@1238 = ~(You pull Vienxay into a hug. She scoffs as she puts a hand on your face.) You are so needy, sometimes.~
@1239 = ~(You playfully let your hand slowly slide down her lower back, before she takes it and places it at your desired end destination for you.) I reward boldness, my beloved.~
@1240 = ~(You find Vienxay returns your affections with a fire, pulling you close as she attacks your lips back viciously.)~
@1241 = ~You kiss so tenderly. I suppose...I do enjoy it.~
@1242 = ~(Vienxay briefly turns her cheeks to deny you access, before she turns your face and gives you the reward you sought.)~
@1243 = ~(Vienxay grabs your face and pulls you in for a strong kiss, her lips peppering yours with passionate fire, before releasing you.)~
@1244 = ~Now that you are here in my sights, let us enjoy a bit of pleasant conversation.~
@1245 = ~Yes, I suppose I would not mind.~
@1246 = ~(You and Vienxay depart together to the inn's baths. The water is steamy and warm when you step in.)~
@1247 = ~This is no Evermeet spring, but it will suffice. Now, let me get you cleaned.~
@1248 = ~Oh, I was hoping we would do something...else.~
@1249 = ~As you wish.~
@1250 = ~Vienxay, offering to clean me? Surprising.~
@1251 = ~Not with that adventuring funk on you.~
@1252 = ~(Vienxay starts from the top, cleaning your face and neck, with a gentle tenderness almost unlike her.~
@1253 = ~I am full of delights and surprises. How lucky you are.~
@1254 = ~She lingers on your chest, circling it several times, before her hand goes down to your stomach, and then even lower. She lingers a moment, before giving you a soft kiss.)~
@1255 = ~You can have more of that attention later. When are done.~
@1256 = ~Are you sure you can wait?~
@1257 = ~I look forward to it.~
@1258 = ~Should I clean you next?~
@1259 = ~She lingers on your breasts, giving each a single kiss, before her hand goes down to your stomach, and then even lower. She lingers a moment, a finger teasingly close, before giving you a third, soft kiss on your lips.)~
@1260 = ~I can. You, on the other hand...your forced waiting will entertain me.~
@1261 = ~(By the time you return to the bedroom, riled and excited, Vienxay more than rewards your waiting, and you find the bliss a welcome distraction before exhaustion takes you into slumber.)~
@1262 = ~Of course. If you can control yourself.~
@1263 = ~Let us get at it, now.~
@1264 = ~Unless...you don't mind a bit of wild lovemaking to carry us into slumber first?~
@1265 = ~We'll be up all night if we do this. Let's just get some rest.~
@1266 = ~Whatever you desire.~
@1267 = ~Not today, Vienxay.~
@1268 = ~As you wish. Straight to rest, then.~
@1269 = ~(She turns from you, and you watch her close her eyes.)~
@1270 = ~(Cuddle her close.)~
@1271 = ~On second thought...~
@1272 = ~Put your arm around me. I find you delightfully warm and I am a little cold.~
@1273 = ~I...love you, <CHARNAME>. Know that as we go to sleep and into our dreams.~
@1274 = ~(You think you see her lips curve into a smile as she feels your body around hers.)~
@1275 = ~Ugh, you are sickeningly sweet. But I love you, <CHARNAME>. Dream well.~
@1276 = ~Hrmph. I suppose I can indulge your lust. I can hardly blame you after all.~
@1277 = ~(Vienxay almost pushes you to your resting place, hands passionately discarding her own clothes before removing whatever is in her way.)~
@1278 = ~(She kisses you over and over again, guiding your hands over her, pressing them into intimate places, and then her own into yours.)~
@1279 = ~(She kisses you over and over again, guiding your hands over her, and then your body into hers.)~
@1280 = ~(The next minutes are marked with sweet bliss, and you find at the end of it your arm draped over her, both of your eyes closed peacefully, your breaths slowing until they find a pace fitting for slumber.)~
@1281 = ~Slumber peacefully.~
@1282 = ~Now, let us get some rest.~
@1283 = ~(You find Vienxay playing what appears to be a lanceboard on a table, alone.)~
@1284 = ~Yes, yes, I know this is a human game, but I find it interesting. Did you want something?~
@1285 = ~I could play against you, if you like.~
@1286 = ~I'm a bit tired, I'll leave you to your fun.~
@1287 = ~Desiring my attention, I see? You can have a peck...Mmm. Now, unless you have something else, I need to beat the only mind as good as mine: My own.~
@1288 = ~You could try. You will fail.~
@1289 = ~(She resets the lanceboard, and motions for you to sit across her). Your move first.~
@1290 = ~(Play aggressively.)~
@1291 = ~(Play defensively.)~
@1292 = ~(You set your pieces in an aggressive motion, trying to set up threats to Vienxay's as soon as you can.)~
@1293 = ~(You play defensively, seeking to set up a protective set-up for your valued king.)~
@1294 = ~(A few moves and lost pieces later, and you notice she has a set defense on the right board, and a few pieces playing a threat on the left side.)~
@1295 = ~(Focus on defending the incoming threat.)~
@1296 = ~(Counter with aggression at her defense.)~
@1297 = ~(You focus on defending your pieces against her threat, trying to carefully keep your king safe.)~
@1298 = ~(You focus on chipping at her defenses, looking for an opening to exploit.)~
@1299 = ~(With both of your plays, the board becomes clearer and clearer. Only a few pieces remain between the both of you, and you have one pawn near the other side.)~
@1300 = ~(Keep trying to keep her King checked to find opportunities to take out pieces.)~
@1301 = ~(Push your pawn down the board to be queened.)~
@1302 = ~(You keep her King under threat as much as you can, limiting her moves to defense.)~
@1303 = ~(You push your pawn to the other side, hoping to get it queened to allow you a powerful ending play.)~
@1304 = ~You make a mistake, not seeing a defending piece in position to take yours, and Vienxay capitalizes on it. You find yourself in checkmate a move later.)~
@1305 = ~(Your pawn is queened, but it is too late. Vienxay executes a move to checkmate you a stroke later.)~
@1306 = ~(Riskily ignoring the threat on the other side, Vienxay has you checkmated suddenly, and wins.)~
@1307 = ~(Your gambit is successful, and Vienxay's King is shortly after checkmated.)~
@1308 = ~Ugh! Impossible. I...miscalculated somewhere. This game infuriates me!~
@1309 = ~What do you have to say now, hmm?~
@1310 = ~Well played, you did your best.~
@1311 = ~I did it, I won!~
@1312 = ~Whatever!~
@1313 = ~(She storms off to her room.)~
@1314 = ~(Leave her be and rest for the night.)~
@1315 = ~(Go after her.)~
@1316 = ~(You find her door locked, and she only huffs at her name calling. She certainly does not take losing well.)~
@1317 = ~(As you return to your room, you swear you hear the words "Next time, I'll get you", coming from her room.)~
@1318 = ~(You find her door unlocked, and when you open it, Vienxay right in front of you. She kisses you fiercely.)~
@1319 = ~You may have beat me, but I will be getting the prize tonight.~
@1320 = ~How can I resist?~
@1321 = ~A mutual prize, I think. I am yours and you are mine.~
@1322 = ~As nice as this is coming from you, I am tired.~
@1323 = ~(Your move fails. She pierces through your defense and your king is checkmated shortly after.)~
@1324 = ~(You find yourself losing a few moves later. Your defensive set-up crumbles almost instantly from a quick cornering of two pieces.)~
@1325 = ~Hrm. You held out long enough. I suppose that is commendable. But I win in the end.~
@1326 = ~I will win next time.~
@1327 = ~You just got lucky.~
@1328 = ~I let you win.~
@1329 = ~You played very well.~
@1330 = ~Impressive. You almost had me. But Vienxay remains unstoppable.~
@1331 = ~A shame. I must say, you have been the easiest player I have ever played in my travels, in the rare times I do play against another. Do not be too offended.~
@1332 = ~(Failing to set up any defense, your vulnerable king is quickly checkmated in only a few moves from a few unseen clever positions from Vienxay.)~
@1333 = ~So you say. We will see.~
@1334 = ~Do you still have time to talk?~
@1335 = ~There is no luck in this game. You are a poor loser.~
@1336 = ~Please. It takes a lot of cleverness to let someone win at this game. Perhaps next time you will do better.~
@1337 = ~Of course. Such games are great exercises for a mage. I got into them as I traveled away from Evermeet. It was a way to make money, I found. But Never mind that.~
@1338 = ~(You find Vienxay sitting cross legged on the ground, going through her spell tome.)~
@1339 = ~So many spells to keep in one's head. I suppose I can...take a moment away from focusing.~
@1340 = ~Could I get you anything?~
@1341 = ~I'm a bit tired, I'll leave you to your studying.~
@1342 = ~Hrm.~
@1343 = ~Some food, I suppose. I have yet to eat.~
@1344 = ~Ah, I don't have any to offer.~
@1345 = ~I am a bit tired to cook. I'll leave you to your studying.~
@1346 = ~Some wine, I suppose. Preferably elven.~
@1347 = ~It's not elven, but I can get that.~
@1348 = ~I am a bit tired to fetch that. I'll leave you to your studying.~
@1349 = ~A kiss. I am sure you would be more than glad to deliver this.~
@1350 = ~As you desire.~
@1351 = ~I'd actually enjoy letting you waiting for it later.~
@1352 = ~(She returns your pecks with a strength, but pulls back after a moment.) It seems I almost distracted myself with my own desires. I'll have to ravage you later.~
@1353 = ~(You reach into your pack and provide some rations for Vienxay.)~
@1354 = ~I was hoping you would cook something. But this is thoughtful.~
@1355 = ~(You depart briefly, only to return in a moment with some wine for Vienxay.)~
@1356 = ~'Tis not the wine of my homeland, but it is something. Thank you.~
@1357 = ~(She smiles at your kiss, though her lips try very hard to hide it.)~
@1358 = ~Hrmph. As you say.~
@1359 = ~Nothing. I am fine.~
@1360 = ~(You find Vienxay pacing her tent restlessly.)~
@1361 = ~Please, don't mind me. Just making sure all of my thoughts are straight before I let my head down.~
@1362 = ~(You find Vienxay in a bedroom, tearing her eyes away from her spell book at your approach.)~
@1363 = ~This is the worst inn ever. Poor choice of place for rest.~
@1364 = ~So many spells. And so many more out there still to grasp.~
@1365 = ~Yes. Understandably, who wouldn't? I had no idea the land looked like this here. I left...and kept my visits extremely brief since.~
@1366 = ~With employment not an option, I resorted to stealing. And the prime option was a church of Red Knight, where soldiers or common people throw their wealth praying that their plans go well.~
@1367 = ~You stole from a church? How could you?~
@1368 = ~Well, not to complain, but leaving Suldanessellar was not my first choice.~
@1369 = ~It was time for us to go.~
@1370 = ~We couldn't stay there forever.~
@1371 = ~We were more or less subtly being asked to leave.~
@1372 = ~Yes, I suppose. Still it was a...very well rewarded relaxation there for a time.~
@1373 = ~I suppose it is simple. We figure out the path ahead so we can enjoy more rest like that. The journey has been undeniably long.~
@1374 = ~Isn't it obvious? We destroy your enemies and move one step closer to your destiny.~
@1375 = ~If only there was another path.~
@1376 = ~So it seems.~
@1377 = ~None of them will stand a chance..~
@1378 = ~After all this time you still wonder about other paths? Perhaps only you could have such beliefs and still live.~
@1379 = ~You have survived so many things, so many obstacles. Together, you will get through all of these "brothers" and "sisters" of yours, as unfitting as it is to say. Only you will stand.~
@1380 = ~I miss my spell preperations. But I guess it means I can get more rest now.~
@1381 = ~(You find Vienxay pouring through one of her spellbooks she can no longer use.)~
@1382 = ~I miss these spells. The sensation. The power. But now I feel even stronger with my shadowmagic. I have to be~
//New Kale rest talk, Vienxay uses the same first line.
@1383 = ~Have you ever thought of having kids?~
@1384 = ~Me? Heh. Ma would kill me if I didn't. I guess since you're asking, it's something you want.~
@1385 = ~Very much so.~
@1386 = ~I don't know. I was just curious.~
@1387 = ~I don't have an interest at all.~
@1388 = ~Well then, when this is over, you'll be baking a few. I'll be making sure of it.~
@1389 = ~I'm glad we're in agreement about this.~
@1390 = ~Why don't we get some practice in now, then?~
@1391 = ~I'm sure you will.~
@1392 = ~It's kind of important to me. We don't have to talk about it now, we don't even know what will happen when all this chaos is over. But after? We can have a proper discussion.~
@1393 = ~We can talk about it, then.~
@1394 = ~What? We have to. It's important to me, darling. Look, we don't have to talk about it now, we don't even know what will happen, but when it's over? We can talk about it then, okay?~
@1395 = ~We don't have to. I'll gladly have children with you to make you happy.~
@1396 = ~Okay.~
@1397 = ~I'm not going to change my mind, Kale.~
@1398 = ~I...don't think I can stay like this, then. The way we are. Can't look at a future like that, and it's a hard to see a future as it is with what's going on.~
@1399 = ~Then...it's over.~
@1400 = ~Let's not be hasty. We can talk about it when everything is over.~
@1401 = ~Thanks, darling. You won't regret reconsidering it, I promise.~
@1402 = ~Yeah...well, was nice while it lasted, eh? Guess I'll just go get some rest.~
//Isaac Rest Talk 
@1403 = ~(Seek out Isaac.)~
@1404 = ~You move to find Isaac.~
@1405 = ~You remember you asked Isaac to spend a bit of time together before you rested.~
@1406 = ~(Go see Isaac.)~
@1407 = ~(You find Isaac sitting in the corner of the room in a chair, sharpening his dagger. When he notices you ener, he sheathes the weapon and rises from the chair.)~
@1408 = ~You have my attention.~
@1409 = ~(Show Isaac your affections)~
@1410 = ~You look handsome, standing like that.~
@1411 = ~I do. What do you want to talk about?~
//Vienxay Kids
@1412 = ~Never. I suppose you have some sort of opinion on it? A negative one, I hope. They're nothing but brats.~
@1413 = ~You were a kid once, you know.~
@1414 = ~I was just curious. Now I know where you stand.~
@1415 = ~I agree, I have no interest at all.~
@1416 = ~I would really like kids someday with you.~
@1417 = ~I know, and I was the exception, being a kid that was an absolute angel. I assume you have an opinion on this you want me to hear if you're asking me this.~
@1418 = ~I have no interest in kids either.~
@1419 = ~Well, we're on the same page. Wonderful, this makes it so much easier. We can do anything we like without anything holding us back.~
@1420 = ~Ugh. I didn't think we'd have a conversation like this now. Fine...this is important to you, isn't it?~
@1421 = ~Not right now. We can talk about it later, when things have settled down.~
@1422 = ~It is.~
@1423 = ~If you really don't want any, I guess I can be okay with that.~
@1424 = ~I doubt it's so easy. Most people sulk and resent. I've seen even those amongst my own people have cold unions because of such things.~
@1425 = ~Your life may never settle down, <CHARNAME>. But I will agree to discuss it then, if that day ever comes.~
@1426 = ~Let me live my youth. I've got decades to enjoy it still. And then...we can talk about it again. Maybe future Vienxay is an idiot.~
@1427 = ~I don't think future Vienxay would like you insulting her like that.~
@1428 = ~Thank you for considering it.~
@1429 = ~I don't have decades, Vienxay.~
@1430 = ~*Sigh*. Just...we can discuss it more another time. No doubt we will have to compromise...to my chagrin. In truth, the idea of a mixed race is...difficult for me, because of how cruel I've been to those like you. So I will need time. I hope you understand.~
@1431 = ~*Smirk* No, she wouldn't. I'm glad we settled that. I don't think I was in a mood with a tense conversation. I'd rather us be strong right now...we need our power to be unsullied by any tension. And there's no point muling on something we may not even survive to achieve.~
@1432 = ~Now your curiousity is answered. Perhaps next time you can bring up this kind of topic when we aren't living a life where we are finding combat and shedding blood on a daily basis. There's no point muling on something we may not even survive to achieve.~
@1433 = ~Something tells me that isn't true.~
@1434 = ~It's true in my opinion. That's all that matters...and yours, from time to time.~
@1435 = ~Agreed. There's no point talking about this anyway, we face so much conflict and bloodshed we don't even have a sort of stable life to think about this sort of thing.~
