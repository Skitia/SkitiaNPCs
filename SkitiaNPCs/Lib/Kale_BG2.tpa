	SAY ~Warden~
	SAY ~WARDEN: The warden is a warrior whose discipline and traditions center around fighting in pairs. The warden takes on the defensive role in the pair, while the ward receives elevated offensive prowess. Their remarkable protective talents come at the cost of the wardenâ€™s skill with weapons being inferior to other fighter traditions.
	
	Advantages:
	-Hit Die: d12
	-May use the Ward ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1, one use at level eight, and an additional use every eight levels thereafter.
	
	WARD: Designates target as the ward for one turn. It does not stack with itself, and if the ward is changed, the previous ward loses their bonuses. 
	Level 1: The ward receives +1 damage bonus and -1 THAC0. The warden receives penalties for the same amount, but gains 10% resistance to physical damage and regenerates 1 hitpoint per 6 seconds.
	Level 8: The ward receives +2 damage bonus and -2 THAC0. The warden receives penalties for the same amount, but gains 20% resistance to physical damage, and regenerates 1 hitpoint per 3 seconds.
	Level 16: The ward receives +3 damage bonus and -3 THAC0. The warden receives penalties for the same amount, but gains 30% resistance to physical damage and regenerates 1 hitpoint per second.

	Disadvantages:
	May only become specialized in ranged weapons, and may not exceed mastery in any other weapon.~

SAY NAME2 ~Kale's Father's Journal~
SAY DESC ~The journal mostly contains details of shopping checklists and dry details of Percy's life. The last few entries however contain some interesting details of note.

"Got in trouble with the guard Bryce again when I got in a scuffle with that awful beggar Martin in the docks. He's always watching from the docks. Got something against halflings, I know he must. When I said I didn't have enough money for his stupid fine over fishing around the docks, I spent a few lousy nights in jail. And that Martin got nothing at all.
Sometimes I think I ought to go wandering again, this city is suffocating my feet. Jillian was the only honest guard member of the docks garrision, but it's not work for a halfling, not with people like Bryce working for them, and she was right to go back wandering with an adventure. She said my son is amongst the adventuring group she is joining.
I ought to introduce myself, but I just can't."

"Chester started selling some new cheese in his cheese shop. Damn it tastes good. Like nothing I've ever had before. Definitely making it a daily addition for my shopping list when I go out and get food."

"Cheese. Cheeeeese. Cheeeeeeeese. I bought up all of the cheese. I promised I'd pay it in full once I had a little bit more money, but Chester doesn't seem to mind at all. What a friendly fellow. Dallie's been getting a bit upset though, that I've been paying more attention to the food than her.
At least she doesn't know about Flora too. I know it's wrong. I know we had a handfasting planned and everything soon, but I love both woman. One for her heart and the other for her appeareance blessed by Sheela herself. What's wrong with playing my luck for a little longer?"

"Money's getting low and Dallie is really getting angry at the stockpile of cheese I got. She won't even taste it despite my protests, she knows it smells good. This stuff is gold. It's worth it all. It's cheeeese. It's heaven. It's amazing.
Even Flora's gotten a bit concerned. She's asking when I'm going to leave her. I don't want to leave anyone. I love Dallie. I love Flora. And I love this cheese too. Just got to enjoy everything while it lasts."

"I think someone's trying to kill me. I feel god awful inside these last few days. I should see a priest, but Chester's amazing cheese always makes me feel a bit happier inside. Just going to buy a bit more before I go off to the church of Ilmater, they're kindly folks there, and I trust them more than anyone.
I'll give Martin a good insult on the way too. He deserves it for getting me in a cell for too many miserable nights."
